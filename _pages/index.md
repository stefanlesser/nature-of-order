This is my collection of notes about the four-book series _The Nature of Order_ by Christopher Alexander.

This website is a living (as in *work-in-progress*) and loose collection of notes, [[Digital Garden]] style.

#### What is _The Nature of Order_ about?
Christopher Alexander's magnum opus _The Nature of Order_ is not a book about architecture. As its subtitle more accurately states, it is "an essay about the art of building and the nature of the universe".

#### Who is Christopher Alexander?
Christopher Alexander is an architect and design theorist known for his theories on human-centered design. His works have inspired the Design Patterns movement in the software industry, which was an adaptation of his publication _A Pattern Language_ to the domain of software architecture.

#### Why should I care about this?
You don't have to be an architect to be interested and become fascinated by Alexander's body of work. Many concepts he discusses in his various books apply to many fields beyond architecture.

Whether you develop software, design things, or create art, Alexander's insights will be relevant to your domain.

This project is my attempt in making the core ideas in _The Nature of Order_ more accessible to a broader audience.
