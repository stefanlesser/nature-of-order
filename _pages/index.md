My collection of notes about the four-book series _The Nature of Order_ by Christopher Alexander.

### About this site
This site is a living (as in *work-in-progress*) and loose collection of notes, [[Digital Garden]] style.

Right now I'm mostly in the process of slowly transferring my private notes taken during my reading to here, editing them slightly so they make more sense and don't require too much context to understand.

Find out what's going on right [[now]]. Help me [[growing this site]].

### Explore
There is no table of contents. You navigate this collection of ideas by following links from one note to another.

Start here: [[About The Nature of Order]]

*There'll be more entry points here soon.*
