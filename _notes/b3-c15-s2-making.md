title: 2 Making

> In the period when I first learned architecture, architects often had this attitude: “Draw the building. Let someone else worry about how to build it.” There was a tendency for 20th-century architects to treat the actual making of a building as a great unmentionable which had to be left to others, not understood through their own hands.  
> But of course that doesn’t make sense. It is only when you treat the raw material of the building as the stuff being shaped, and take control of it — either with your own hands, or at least only asking other people to do with their hands what you yourself know how to do with *your* hands — that you can make a real thing, something which has worth.  

> In the making of the building you must be involved yourself — and you must view the art of building as an act of *making* in order to get the right results.
