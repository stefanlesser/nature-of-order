title: 1 The link of human happiness with the environment

### Ordinary human happiness and living structure in the physical world are connected
When architectural structure is created through unfolding, it creates an environment in which people can feel happy. Within the dead structure of the conceptual and designed modern environment this blissful state is almost unattainable. What it means to be a person depends on the physical structure of the world. 

The world around us requires a special looseness — living structure — to allow normal human life to run its normal state. The places where this occurs are morphologically different from today’s developed architecture.

We want an architecture where people can live as human beings in a normal, blissful, ordinary state. This is part of the nature and an attribute of the unfolded, generated world. It is not an attribute of the planned, designed, developed world.

### Belonging
Belonging = condition in the world that allows us to exist as free beings, to pass our time in a fashion that we know we are in places that belong to us — so that the world is ours in spirit; hinges on real freedom, joy, ability to love, ability to follow passions, ability to be yourself, within your social and cultural contexts.
