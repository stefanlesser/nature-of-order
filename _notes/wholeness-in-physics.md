<- [[Wholeness]]

Wholeness as a fundamental part of physics:

> The wholeness, defined as the pattern of centers in some part of space, is not only the **underlying causative structure** in matters of architecture and art â€” but that even the behavior of subatomic particles, electrons, is also governed by this wholeness. Wholeness is a truly pervasive structure, which **acts at all scales**.
