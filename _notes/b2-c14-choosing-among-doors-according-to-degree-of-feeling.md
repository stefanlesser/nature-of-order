title: "Choosing among doors according to degree of feeling"
---

> The judgements one can make about the feeling created by these doors in the wall are necessarily incomplete, since the degree of feeling of each one — if it were a real door — would depend on more information about the context and character of the building in which the door is to be placed. Nevertheless, we can see different degrees of feeling in each door, even in these rudimentary sketches.  

> Of course I am simplifying the situation drastically, since in a real case, my decision will be affected by the extent to which tie door *in its context*, has the most feeling. That would make an enormous difference. The most profound center would be affected and modified by the context — would, indeed, grow out of it — just as the door with most feeling, would also be modified by the context. But I want to be clear that even without this refinement, the question makes sense, and can be answered, as in this elementary example.
