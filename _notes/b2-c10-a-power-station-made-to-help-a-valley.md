> The smaller center (the fifteen-acre site of the new power station) is placed and formed and shaped in its entirety in such a way to bring the most good to the larger center (the whole valley). The benefit to the region of Earth where this power station is to be built is obvious. But as things stand, the center-forming process is not represented in the present process by any present political power, or by any operational step in the present process. Yet, in principle, such a process is clearly possible.
