title: "Uniqueness arises naturally from sequence from doing things in the proper order and from the appropriateness of repetition"
---

> The organic unfolding of a building tells us *when* these various decisions must be made. And the *consequence* of deciding things at the right moment, when correctly done, is that the building and all its parts become unique. The sterile modularity and inappropriate sameness of 20th-century parts came about directly as a result of taking things in the wrong order.  

> The way that the fundamental process creates living structure is like biological and natural unfolding, but *unlike* much modern architectural design and construction, in the all-important respect which concerns the size, character, repetition, and non-modularity of component elements.  

> What emerges from differentiation is not a loose, funky, rounded, kind of organicism. The buildings which the fundamental process creates, in the sphere of building, are still dominated by rectangles or near rectangles â€” because the rectangle is, after all, the main shape of easily built inhabited space that has positive space on both sides of every wall.
