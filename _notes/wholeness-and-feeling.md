title: Wholeness and feeling
---

> Living structure is, by its very nature, personal and feeling-endowed. The field of centers exists in a thing *to that degree to which the thing has personal feeling*.

---

> I do not insist that this is true. But I ask you to make a note of the fact that it might be true that **what is personal can be directly and clearly identified in the realm of feeling — and that it happens to correspond to the presence of the field of centers**.

---

> Perhaps we are beginning to see that life — because of its structure, the field of centers — is inextricably connected with human feeling. If we look back over the examples of buildings, places, landscapes, paintings, and objects that I have shown as having life, we can see that **they also are bound up with, and cause in us, deep personal feeling. They *have* deep feeling. They awaken feeling in us. They make us feel our own existence.** It is this increased feeling of life which we experience in ourselves that lets us know these things are important. We cannot separate them, or our awareness of them, from the fact that they have feeling and induce feeling in us.
> 
> This deep feeling is indeed a *mark* of life in things. It is, from a human point of view, perhaps the most important aspect of life in buildings — because it is the aspect which **connects that life, most directly, and most wonderfully, with our own existence, with what it is to be alive**. And it shows us that the life in buildings, which makes them work, which makes them alive in *themselves*, also is connected to *us*, is *personal*.
> 
> Although **within the canon of normal contemporary science we cannot imagine a kind of objective truth which is also personal in nature**, this combination is one of the most extraordinary and important aspects of the new structure which I call the wholeness. As the centers deepen, the personal feeling of the structure increases. If its personal feeling does not increase, its structure is not really getting deeper. Precisely *this* feeling component is its extraordinary property.
> 
> Further, and very fundamentally stated, *we become happy in the presence of deep wholeness*. When I am in a building which has life, I have a happiness in me, a comforting and profound wholesomeness. **Unlike those structures pursued by science, which are remote from us and have only mechanical reality, the field of centers is somehow part of us, connected with the very essence of being human.**

---

> In the Cartesian view, the objective structure of the world is one thing, our own happiness is something entirely different and remote from it. In the post-Cartesian view, the wholeness of the world and our feeling of happiness *together* are understood to be two complementary things which form a single unity.
