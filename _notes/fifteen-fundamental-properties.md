Recurring identifiable structural characteristics of objects and buildings which **manifest in their geometric features**.

> Objects and buildings which have life all have certain **identifiable structural characteristics**. The same **geometric features** keep showing up in them, again and again.

Alexander empirically took notes about different objects and buildings, by comparing them and determining which has more life and eventually recognized geometric patterns in those things that had more life and missing these features in those things that had less life.

### Characteristics of dead things
> Systems in space which have these fifteen properties to a strong degree will be alive, and the more these properties are present, the more the systems which contain them will tend to be alive.
> […]
> The things and systems in the world which are most dead — the most **image-laden** buildings and artifacts, the most **sterile** housing projects, the most **damaged** ecological systems, the most poisoned streams — will have these properties to the *least* degree.

Other characteristics lead to “dead” objects and artifacts:

- image-laden, egocentric
- sterile
- damaged/damaging (in the sense of ecology), e.g., a poisoned stream and its consequences

### Centers strengthening each other
The 15 properties are the **principal ways** in which **centers strengthen each other**.

> I believe that these properties arise because they are **the principal ways in which centers can be strengthened** by other centers. They are, if you like, fifteen ways of talking about centers, and the way that the existence and life of centers dominates the existence of life in the world.

Each property describes one way in which centers can intensify each other.
Through such intensification of centers, space becomes coherent or unified and thus more alive.

> *Each of the properties describes one of the possible ways in which centers can intensify each other.* Each one defines **one type of spatial relationship** between two or more centers, and then shows how the mutual intensification works in the framework of this relationship.
> In effect, the fifteen properties are **the glue, through which space is able to be unified**. The fifteen properties provide the ways that centers can intensify each other. **Through the intensity of centers, space becomes coherent.** As it becomes coherent, it becomes alive. The fifteen properties are the “ways” it comes to life.

### The 15 properties
Through observation, Alexander identified 15 different ways in which centers can help each other come to life:

1. [[Levels of scale]]
2. [[Strong centers]]
3. [[Boundaries]]
4. [[Alternating repetition]]
5. [[Positive space]]
6. [[Good shape]]
7. [[Local symmetries]]
8. [[Deep interlock and ambiguity]]
9. [[Contrast]]
10. [[Gradients]]
11. [[Roughness]]
12. [[Echoes]]
13. [[The void]]
14. [[Simplicity and inner calm]]
15. [[Not-separateness]]

### Learning to recognize and use the 15 properties
Intellectually understanding the 15 properties by their definitions is not sufficient. True understanding can only be achieved by actively and practically trying (and failing, at first) to create things that have certain properties, but not just *have* them, but *gain deeper feeling because of the presence of the property*.

> I use this rule to help people understand the fifteen properties: “Draw diagrams, make experiments, in which you try to make something, sketch something, which has the property in it. But it is not enough to catch the property as you believe it is defined. To succeed, **you must make a thing which has the property, *and which gains deeper feeling because of the presence of the property***. Only when you have managed that, can you be sure that the meaning of the property has not eluded you.”

> It takes years — perhaps three, five, ten years — to learn the process of making centers, and to know what it means to make a center come to life. In the meantime, the properties are a very **useful tool**; they are a way of **focusing our attention on the centers**. By following the properties, even if blindly, like a mechanical tool, we gradually come to know more and more and more about the life of centers — we appreciate the way that centers interact, we learn to make the life of one center more intense, by adding, or providing other centers — and the property thus teaches us, concretely, more and more about how we can make centers come to life. That is the whole ball game in the end.

### Fifteen
Although Alexander is pretty sure he found a good set of properties, there could be more. But the number is not as important as the order of magnitude — there aren’t going to be many more and this means relatively few elements, which we can hopefully one day understand and perhaps even explain precisely (mathematically) can produce all the complexity and beauty in the world, simply because the number of ways in which centers can be in relationships with each other is limited.

*In a fully connected graph, relations between nodes increase exponentially with the number of nodes. This is like taking advantage of this rule by using its reverse.*

> The precise number fifteen is not significant. But I do believe that the order of magnitude of the number is significant. Throughout my efforts to define these properties, it was always clear that there were **not five, and not a hundred, but *about* fifteen** of these properties. It wasn’t possible to go on listing new ones indefinitely.
> There is no certainty that this list is exhaustive. On the other hand, if you try to think up other effect which are combinatorially different from these, you will find it is not very easy. When we focus on the mathematical ways in which centers can be built out of other centers, or the ways in which one center helps to make other centers stronger, **there is a limit to the number of ways** in which this can be done.
