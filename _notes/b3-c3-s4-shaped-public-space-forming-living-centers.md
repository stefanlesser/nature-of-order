title: 4 Shaped public space forming living centers
---

### Positive space, solid space
> Each part of the downtown, and each part of each neighborhood, is to be a strong center. In our ideal city, when we are finished, there are to be no places that are not living centers. This will be true of each part — each center — in the downtown area; there is to be **nothing left over**.  

### The void is itself a place
> Even the void is itself a place — solid, continuous, empty, bounded, visible, and felt *as* the void.  

### The right kind of space for cars
> Our modern destroyed space has come about largely because with the onset of cars, 2000 years of tradition about forming pedestrian, horse and carriage space, suddenly dissolved — became irrelevant — and we have hardly yet found a new tradition in which the rules of the game — the patterns, the generic types of centers for parking, cars, movement of cars, deliveries, is clear and worked out in relation to the hulls of public pedestrian space.  

> Undoubtedly, the pure pedestrian space in which there are no cars is also vital, allowing us to walk, dream, play, unhurried and uninterrupted.
