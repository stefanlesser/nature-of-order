title: "Other recent steps in the evolution of society which have been taking place through the shared use of patterns"

> Although the static non-process format of the patterns was less powerful than the sequences under discussion in this book, still the patterns had a very large effect. The building forms that were introduced in this “genetic” way have now, twenty-five years later, become part of the vernacular of our time. It is reasonable to expect that sequences, with their inherently far greater power, will have a greater effect.  

Sequences are an evolution of patterns (as in _A Pattern Language_).
