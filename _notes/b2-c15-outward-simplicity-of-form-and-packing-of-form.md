title: "Outward simplicity of form and packing of form"

> In some cases the “brutal” effect of geometry takes rather simple character. It is not always a matter of load-bearing structure as it is in the previous case. In the case shown here, the Sala house in Berkeley, it is more a matter of pure geometry, once again relying on the framework of an aperiodic grid as the basis for differentiation — but applied to the *space* and rooms, not only to the building structure.  

> A rigid and definite geometry is introduced in a nearly brutal manner, but is then treated, bent, filled, and modified, so that its coherent existence, while being adapted to rooms, circumstances, needs, and land, is nevertheless able to happen beautifully within a visible and satisfying order.
