### Differentiating space
latent, half-formed structure -> coherent, fully-developed

> To understand the way a living process helps us achieve living structure by **differentiating space**, let us consider, in detail, how space does actually get differentiated, and how a person may use the differentiating process to move steadily, again and again, **from latent, half-formed structure to fully developed, coherent structure**.  

### 15 Transformations
Transform latent centers by differentiation.
Nudge a system steadily towards living structure.
	1. Purely mathematical / formal
		* have their origin in the nature of space itself
		* do not arise as a result of “function”
			* used in the service of function
			* but not functional in origin
	2. Increase the life of the whole
		* cannot be applied blindly, but must be applied appropriately
		* must act in service of function

> Latent centers may be transformed by differentiation (through the use of the fifteen transformations) in such a way that the system of centers as a whole becomes intensified or more alive.   

> Two things should be noticed about these transformations:  
> *First, they are purely mathematical, that is, formal.* **They have their origin only in the nature of space itself, and do not arise as a result of “function”.** They are used, in all real cases (buildings, biological systems, physical systems) in the service of function — but **they are not functional in *origin***. They are pure transformations of space itself, through which the space becomes differentiated, and through which the life of the space is increased.  
> *Second, as a result of the application of these transformations, the life of the whole is increased.*  
> I do not mean to imply that these transformations can be applied blindly, in the hope of getting life to occur. **They must always be *appropriate*. They must act in the service of function**; they must be undertaken, always, with an eye to local adaptation, and so on.  

> We do have a system of transformations which are, in principle, capable of **nudging a system steadily towards living structure**, and these transformations are precisely those transformations which govern the life of the centers themselves — and hence the wholeness (which *is* the system of centers), too.
