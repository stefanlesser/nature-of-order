> What might this new world be like?  
> What, in practice, would the system of society be like as the paradigm shifts, and living processes give us the right to experience and consolidate our feelings and our passions?  
> I believe four general features of the overall system of society will turn out to be fundamental:  

> 1. All processes having impact on the environment (any impact) will slowly need to be re-thought and reconstituted as morphogenetic sequences.  
> We thus move away from the inchoate conglomeration of individual rules and processes described in chapters 17-18, and start replacing them with processes that are explicitly *morphogenetic*. We begin to envisage a world in which every process — every rule, every human interaction, every purpose-filled act which touches the environment — has among its tasks the major task of creating coherent living form.  
> And, slowly, this needs to be understood by everyone: By administrators, inventors, actors, users, builders, children. We begin living in a world in which the ongoing, continuous creation of living structure through processes aimed at *shape* becomes our conscious aim, in every part of daily life.  

> 2. The morphogenetic sequences at large in society slowly coalesce to form a more coherent system. Thousands of morphogenetic sequences will exist in people’s minds: Although these sequences may exist freely, and independently of one another, they will slowly become linked to one another, forming a continuous net of sequences, mutually calling on each other.  
> In the future, the members of society — all of us together — will begin more and more to see, feel, think, and conceive these “shaping”-sequences as linked. This will have the result that a fluid over-arching process, created piecemeal by the actions of thousands and millions of people, slowly begins taking care of the whole, and we understand how it does so.  

> 3. Our shared focus shifts towards the task of improving these world-wide sequences through evolution. Continuous and deliberate creation, improvement, and evolution of the generative sequences, becomes a widespread feature of discussion in many segments of society.  
> At present, since sequences are largely hidden from view, or unconscious, there is little opportunity — little point, too — in discussion or debate about the relative merits of different sequences.  
> But as morphogenetic sequences come more and more into view, and are used by more and more people, it becomes natural for people to consider making or modifying their own sequences, sharing and exchanging ideas, trying consciously to improve the sequences they know — and then, finally, people begin to see that it is part of their obligations to share the material they have, to deposit improved sequences in the common gene pool, so that others may gain the benefit, also.  

*This is all the How-To articles that exist on the Internet.*

> Such sequences *all* have the important character that deeper aspects of structure are laid down first, and that subsequent steps always follow smoothly. This, too, merits discussion, and will slowly become a matter of common awareness.  

> 4. More generally, I believe, we shall all gradually come to feel a concrete and realistic obligation to make sure that every action taken, by anyone, in any place, always, heals the land.  
> A widespread ethical change begins to appear. Healing the land is understood by more and more people: Throughout society, slowly each person comes to recognize his or her fundamental obligation to make sure that in every act of *every* kind, each person does what he or she can do to heal the land and to regenerate, shape, form, decorate, and improve the living Earth of which we are a part.
