<- [[The fundamental process]]

1. At any given moment in a process, we have a certain **partially evolved state** of a structure. This state is described by the wholeness: the system of centers, and their relative nesting and degrees of life.
2. We **pay attention** as profoundly as possible to this wholeness â€” its global, large-scale order, both actual and latent.
3. We try to **identify** the sense in which this structure is weakest as a whole, **weakest in its coherence** as a whole, most deeply lacking in feeling.
4. We **look for the latent centers** in the whole. These are not those centers which are robust and exist strongly already; rather, they are centers which are **dimly present in a weak form**, but which seem to us to **contribute to or cause the current absence of life** in the whole.
5. We then **choose one of these latent centers** to work on. It may be a large center, or middle-sized, or small.
6. We **use one or more of the fifteen structure-preserving transformations**, singly or in combination, to **differentiate and strengthen** the structure in its wholeness.
7. As a result of the differentiation which occurs, **new centers are born**. The extent of the fifteen properties which accompany creation of new centers will also take place.
8. In particular we shall have increased the strength of certain larger centers; we shall also have increased the strength of parallel centers; and we shall also have increased the strength of smaller centers. As a whole, the structure will now, as a result of this differentiation, **be stronger and have more coherence** and definition as a living structure.
9. We **test** to make sure that this is actually so, and that the **presumed increase of life has actually taken place**.
10. We also **test** that what we have done is the **simplest differentiation possible**, to accomplish this goal in respect of the center that is under development.
11. When complete, we **go back** to the beginning of the cycle, and apply the same process again.
