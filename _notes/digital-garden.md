## What's a Digital Garden?
Somewhat between a weblog and a wiki, a Digital Garden is a public website with a collection of notes.

In contrast to a blog, the notes are not necessarily meant to be polished articles in chronological order. Instead they offer a glimpse into the author's current thinking on topics they care about.

In contrast to a wiki, the notes are not necessarily organized in an encyclopedic way. Instead you discover what you are most interested in by following crosslinks from one note to another choose-your-own-adventure style.
