title: "Improving zoning rules"

> We can predict that the loss of the centers in the space of the garden inherently reduces life, since the building, unsupported by next-door centers, will have life to a lesser extent than it might if the space around were used to good advantage. Under these circumstances it is harder for an individual house to make a contribution to the larger neighborhood. That is because, given the extreme rigidity of the zoning rule on a small lot, the house volume has little play left in it — it is virtually fixed in its position (and ultimately in volume) by the four imaginary lines parallel to the lot lines which define the zoning envelope.  

> The imposition of the setback rule makes is harder — often nearly impossible — for a family, or a builder, or an architect — to create living structure. Once again, we are not *free* to do what is right, what is most natural, what is best for the neighborhood.  

*This zoning rule surely comes from the idea of making each lot independent from each other — to reduce coupling. But if we design in a way that doesn’t require coordination with what’s nearby, how can we expect it to be harmonious with what’s nearby? In addition, this rule also tries to avoid conflict by introducing sensible minimum distances, but the cost for that is wasted land which could be used much more effectively if potential conflict was avoided through coordination instead. There is an exchange here of _?_ for rigidity.*

*Lots of rigidity in programming too… how can we get rid of that?*

> We evaluate the relative life of a process by making predictions based on thought-experiments or simulations. We gauge the likelihood that living structure will appear under the impact of this particular process. We try to imagine a better process which solves noise and daylight problems between neighbors, while generating more positive space.  
> Whatever form this new process takes, even if only partially successful, it will make us more free to do what is right, and what is best for the neighborhood, and best for our individual homes.
