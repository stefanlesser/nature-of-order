title: "Love of life"

> “Paying attention to the wholeness” is essentially synonymous with love of life. […] It means taking in the whole, enjoying it, seeing it all, bathing in it, *loving* it.  

> And I believe one can state truly that in traditional society, the actions, step by step, and small adaptations which make up the structure-preserving transformations are indeed born out of this awareness and love of everything around.  

*So in the end we don’t have a process problem or an architectural problem, but a problem of individualism and lack of feeling for others.*

> Even in the biggest buildings of traditional society, it is this love of life — love of the whole — which manifests itself in the smallest actions. It is, then, this love of life which is embodied in the conception of a building, in its detail, in its execution — because the wholeness that people paid attention to really was the whole, really was *all* of life, and people were not ashamed or too frightened to respond to *all* of it in their actions as builders.
