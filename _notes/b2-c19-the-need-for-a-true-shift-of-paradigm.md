title: "The need for a true shift of paradigm"

> We have, for more than a hundred years, been used to a fully mechanized process where the human organization of construction is itself mechanized (not by equipment, but by the character of the *human* process). What people say and do, what their responsibilities are, how their work is defined, how institutions cut up the process into bits â€” by the end of the 20th century, the mechanical nature of all these human processes was accepted as normal, and is today taken for granted. But, in spite of the advantages this has provided to the modern age, the processes are also damaging to life.  

> In order to institute a widespread, *overall* living process in our 21st century, this must be (slowly) swept away. We must find ways to transform, *throughout society*, our mental ways, our processes, our ways of thinking and doing, in every field that touches the environment.
