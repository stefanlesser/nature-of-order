title: "Slow improvement of *all* social processes"
---

> The processes at work in society take a great variety of ordinary outward forms. All these processes can be modestly improved. We are beginning to see that making changes in the social process is possible, even when conceived in a vast array of different spheres, all having effect on eat shape of the world.  

## Which kinds of processes Alexander tried to influence with each of his books
> These proposed innovations have all been innovations of *process*.  
> I made the innovations long ago, and in most cases, long before I wrote this book, *simply because I knew the living architecture I was aiming at would be dependent on changes in the character of process*.  
> Furthermore, these processes all embodied (in one form or another) the fifteen transformations at every stage of their action. They were, therefore, morphogenetic processes (as defined below).  
> At the time when I first made them, these process innovations were often dismissed as dreaming, as too radical for an architect to propose.  
> Nevertheless, fundamental practical innovations of process are inevitable consequences of thinking correctly about the nature of living structure in buildings, and of facing honestly the task of creating living structure in the world.

> *It is precisely those innovations which attempts to change the system of processes most deeply, that are hardest for society to accept*, and therefore hardest to implement.  
> This is because the really deep changes are ones which change jobs, and which therefore actually alter the capacity of the social system to let people create wholeness in the world, or to allow it to be created. These kinds of changes — the fundamental ones which are actually needed in society — are at odds with many institutions, not only with individual processes, but in some cases with the whole structure of our institutions as they have developed during the last sixty years.  

> Up until now, we have simply misunderstood the nature of architectural process. We have not understood how profoundly living process in design and building is related to life, altogether, and how life then emanates directly out of living process in society.  
> The practical impediments to the creation of living structure in the world will gradually be removed, I believe, once we begin to recognize that social process must necessarily be *architectural* process, and that architectural process must *necessarily* be life-creating, a process *which can support the continuous creation of an emerging living structure in the world*.  
> That requires not merely that we improve the sequences and processes of our society. It requires, specifically, that we make these processes architectural. That means they must be morphogenetic.
