title: Order is difficult to describe

It is difficult to precisely describe what order is

> In a sense, everyone knows what order is. But when I really ask myself “what *is* order” — in the sense of deep geometric reality, deep enough so that I can use it, and so that it is able to help me create life in a building — then it turns out that this “order” is very difficult to define.

We can’t define order in a precise and useful way. \
However, we have intuition for order. We can *feel* it.

> Are these intuitions objectively verifiable? Is there actually *less* order in these later examples than in the earlier examples? Or is it just a *different* order?

*Does feeling the presence of beauty mean there is more order, or does it mean there is a difference in the kind of order present?*
