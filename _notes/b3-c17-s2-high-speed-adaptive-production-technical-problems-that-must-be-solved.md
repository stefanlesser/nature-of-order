title: "2 High-speed adaptive production: technical problems that must be solved"
---

> The processes must deliver high-volume, high-efficiency production that were typical of 20th-century mass production, while *also* delivering a new standard of uniqueness, love of art and craft, and careful adaptation of detail and variety which was common in the production of the pre-industrial, pre-literate centuries a thousand years ago.  
> To accomplish this seeming tour-de-force, it will not be sufficient to try for some kind of *mixture* of the two systems of production. Rather, what will have to be provided is a new form of process, a uniquely 21st-century and ultra-modern form of process, different from those of the 20th century, and also vastly different from those of the 12th century: a new kind of process, altogether new, in conception, detail, execution, and conceptual structure.  

> Some of the key features of the new process configuration which are to be discussed include the following:  
> - Extensive use of computers.  
> - Extensive use of handcraft and hand-eye sensitivity translated to component manufacture through computer-intense technology linkage.  
> - Partial prefabrication undertaken to allow detailed on-site adaptation and adjustment.  
> - Off-site production.  
> - Off-site testing of partially completed configurations.  
> - Use of ultra-high-technology cutting and forming equipment.  
> - Further adaptation on site at time of installation.  
> - On-site modification of pre-formed components.  
> - Adaptation in off-site mockup facilities.  
> - Subtle adaptation of shape, color, geometry, and form of components as the on-site space develops in shape and degree of completion.
