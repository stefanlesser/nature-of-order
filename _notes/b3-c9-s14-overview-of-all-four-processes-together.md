> The combination of these transformations, taken together, slowly creates public space that is coherent, creating pedestrian hulls that are coherent; and it creates the possibility of unique individual businesses and houses and apartments, interleaved with vibrant green gardens that are also unique and well shaped between the houses, helping to form the common land.  

> We are asking ourselves how the neighborhood may be transformed so that living centers are created. Among the most vital kinds of living centers are the houses and businesses. If they are not unique, each one properly adapted to its unique family or business, then of course it cannot be a living center. So to assure a neighborhood of the growth of living centers, we must make provision for splitting the lots. Without it, we get condominiums, apartment houses, office blocks. The reason for the radical proposal I have made is that it follows directly from the simple rule of all living process: Let us make sure that every house and every business, and every garden, and every public space is a true living center.  
> In the same vein, we know that the community cannot exist as a living center without a kernel, a core, where people meet, play, dream. […] So, to make a process which creates these centers of public space in the yellow space — the hulls of pedestrian space — we must also make these centers live.
