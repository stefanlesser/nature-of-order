title: The expanding and contracting of our humanity
---

> It is not only *human* situations which cause the expanding and contracting of my humanity. *It is everything in my surroundings*, my experience, the physical world I pass through, the activities and actions I encounter. Even architectural details are like this. **They support me, or they deny me, in varying degrees.** An ordinary iron railing may be very positive. It is no big thing, but as I look at it, as I am aware of being with it, very, very slightly I **feel more of a person, a little bit more valuable**. Or, on another occasion, I may be looking at a thermostat on the wall, I may feel the opposite. The thermostat itself — the box — is not ugly. It is just ordinary. But when I contemplate it, and contemplate the state I am in as a result of being with that thing in that box, very, very slightly I feel less of a person, and my humanity is falling off again.

*Or is it about feeling _valued_ by the thing?*

> **A thing with more living structure makes me more of a person, another thing with less living structure makes me less of a person.** All the time, as I go through the world, I feel the expanding and diminishing of my humanity. Of course it comes from me and is caused by me, but it is caused, too, by my interaction with the world; and it is different for the different things which I encounter.

*Strong connection to user experience again: if a process (provided in software) or a user interface for any kind of object makes me feel respected, it is more alive then when if doesn’t respect me as much as a person.*
