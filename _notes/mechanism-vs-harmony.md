title: Mechanism vs. harmony
---

### Mechanism
**Physics** only helps us talk about **purely mechanical order**, viewing objects as mechanisms.

> What is the *order* which physics helps us talk about in each of these cases? It is only the *mechanical* order. The order is always described — and even invented — in relation to the way the thing works as a mechanism.

> [T]he beauty and order [we] yearn for, cannot be expressed in any way that can be understood mechanically.

Mechanism is mostly concerned with **producing effects** — *function*.

> Although 20th-century science gives us a way of seeing **order as a producer of effects** — in particular because the scientific view of things shows us the **geometry of matter as if it were part of a machine**, a machine which can *do* certain things — we still do not have a way of seeing the order of a thing which *simply exists*.

Beauty doesn’t have to be functional. *Or it is functional on a different level?*

-> [[Function vs. ornament]]

### Harmony
What impresses and moves us though, is *harmony* — an aspect of order we [[order is difficult to describe|cannot describe well]] and which **defies specification as pure mechanism**.

If you can’t make a distinction between mechanism and harmony, because your [[Mechanical-rationalist world view|world view doesn’t allow it]], you are confined to believe that a difference between these concepts has to be a difference *in degree* — a higher level of complexity. Although it might in fact be a difference *in kind*.

### Connection to software
*This seems even more true for software: here we see everything as a sequence of operations that modify state or a sequence of transformations that change a data structure. In a way, in software we seem to be limited to a simplistic form of sequential order.*
