title: Metaphorical structure in the two arches example
---

Drawing A looks like an arrow, it’s pointing up, or rather, into the building, if we consider how perspective works with the visual perception of our three-dimensional surroundings. Consequentially, drawing A feels like a doorway that invites you to go through it. While drawing B does not.

My hypothesis is that this suggests that we “understand” drawing A through a kinesthetic image schema or spatial metaphorical structure that takes advantage of the embodiment of direction — up or inside. 

Drawing B is missing that feature and therefore doesn’t trigger the same response. Perhaps drawing B even triggers an opposite response, because its structure and visual geometry emphasizes a blocked path, or and end of a path in some way, even though it is an arch leading into something. Its flat shape at the top looks more like a barrier.

*I wonder if this could be tested with an experiment where people get fMRI scans to compare which regions in the brain light up when looking at both these arches, potentially photos of real arches with these same properties, and drawings or pictures that represent image schemas for spatial metaphor up or inside.*
