title: The unity that speaks of I
---

### Intro to part 2
> What I have presented in these four books is intended to become a part of **a new science** — a first sketch of **a new kind of scientific theory**.
> 
> Since the creation of a work of building must always be, at root, creation of living structure, I have built to the best of my ability a picture of living structure and of the process that can generate living structure. The picture is sufficient, I believe, for working architects to carry in our minds, **a vision of our task**.
> But this picture necessarily **touches physics**. The existence of living structure, as I have defined it, requires **modifications in our physical picture of the world**, not only in the picture which we have of architecture. And, in the most subtle phases of this work, we are forces — I believe — by the arguments presented in Book 4, to go still further. It is not enough merely to have a picture of living structure, but necessary, also, to recognize that there is something ineffable, a mystical core in things, that is deeply related to our own individual self, and that *this* — not something else — is the true core both of matter and of architecture. That, too, must find expression

### Intro to chapter 6
> To make the reader share with me my sense of what is really happening in the architectural examples where life appears, I shall now try to describe something — a feeling so remote from our ordinary sense of things, that it may have to be called *meta*-physical — truly beyond physics.

> This — what I describe in this chapter — is how I experience the reaching for the ultimate unity when a building or an ornament is being made. It is also how I experience its effect when it *has* been made. Far-fetched or not, this is what appears to me to be going on, this is how I *do* experience the presence of the mysterious and ultimate quality that can occur in a made thing.
> 
> The experience concerns the universal I — how it is felt, how it appears when it comes into a work, what it appears *as*, how it functions in establishing a relatedness between the work and the person and the universe.
> 
> Somehow — whether it be in color, or in a harmonious garden, or in a room whose light and mood are just right, or in the awesome wall of a great building which allows us to walk near it — some placid, piercing unity occurs, sharp and soft, embracing, tying all things together, wrapping us up in it, allowing us to feel our own unity.
