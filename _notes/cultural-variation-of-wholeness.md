title: Cultural variation of wholeness

<- [[Wholeness]]

> In human society, the wholeness of a given part of space always includes the cultural milieu.

> [*The wholeness*] W — that is, the particular system of centers — governs and defines the cultural variation which we experience in the world.

*Embodied cognition identifies many activities that are universal across cultures. But it also acknowledges cultural differences. It all comes together: perhaps here also [[Human feeling is 90% the same across people|90% are universal]] and 10% specific to local culture? Then we would really have lots to agree on. But these things evade our consciousness so well that we miss them and primarily see the differences.*
