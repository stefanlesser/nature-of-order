title: The appeal to shared experience
---

Science is about sharing. Objectiveness is a means to being universal, which means shared among all of us.

> The factual character of modern science — what we call its objective nature — arises chiefly from the fact that **its results can be shared**. The method of Descartes — the observation of limited events that are tied to a limited and machine-like view of some phenomenon — creates a circumstance in which **we all reach roughly the same results when we do the same experiments**. It is this which allows us to reach a picture which is *shared*, and this in turn which then leads us to call the picture so created an “objective” picture.

However, wholeness cannot be observed like this.

> To see the phenomenon of life as it really is, the methods used **cannot be tied to the crutch of mechanism** as the basis for the sharing of observations and results.

---

> The matters in this book are **as objective — as dependent on experience and as likely to give sharable, repeatable, results — as the experiments and observations that are permitted by Cartesian method**. But they extend and supplement the arena of permissible scientific observations *in such a way that the self of the observer is allowed to come into the picture in an objective way*.

> I want to emphasize that this method of observation, like the method of Descartes, still refers always to *experience*. *It is empirical in nature.* It dismisses fantasy and seeks constantly to avoid speculation. In this sense, it is as empirical as the method of Descartes. But where Descartes only allowed observation to focus on the **outer reality of mechanisms** in the world, my method requires that we focus on the **inner reality of feeling** *as well*.
