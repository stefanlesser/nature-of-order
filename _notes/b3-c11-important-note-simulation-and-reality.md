> I have laid emphasis […] in the importance of reality: that is to say, on the importance of laying out streets and houses *in the land itself*, as a direct response to its hollows, slopes, flat places, wooded areas, trees, nearby streets, buildings, paths and watercourses — not through the medium of construction drawings or permit drawings (which are inevitably sterile).
