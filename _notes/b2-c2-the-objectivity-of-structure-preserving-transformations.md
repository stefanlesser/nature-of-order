title: "The objectivity of structure-preserving transformations"
---

> What is more structure-preserving and what is less so is, in principle, an objective matter.  

> The goodness of a given structure-preserving transformation can be assessed accurately only by a person who sees the wholeness accurately. It is, in the end, not a judgement of opinion, but a judgement about the wholeness which actually exists.  
> Surprisingly, it turns out that this judgement is objective and well-defined even in those cases where people find it difficult to be specific in *defining* the structure which exists.
