title: "More snippable short sequences — Construction sequences as process genes"
---

> It is difficult to find social conditions in which *all* the features of the construction process can change *at the same time*, hence extremely difficult to introduce such a new process as a whole.  

> What was difficult or impossible as a larger act of social transformation, becomes possible when one uses a genetic approach to achieve the same aims. What is needed is simply a way of “cutting up” the original innovative process, into a small set of process genes or *small* sequences that work individually, and that are robust enough to work in a wide variety of contexts, even when not supported by other parts of the new system.  

*Isn’t that exactly how structured programming works and how the most basic library functions come into being?*

*This is where generality and composability are important features — they are features of the steps in sequences (which itself can be sub-sequences, just like functions can call other functions within themselves).*

> (Of course, this is the way technological evolution takes place, *anyway*. But we are talking, now, about the possibility of injecting *morphogenetic* sequences into the mainstream.)
