title: "Will deep feeling really be possible? In 21st-century society"
---

> It must be admitted that our society, modern industrial society, does not usually work in such a way that the whole *can* be given profound feeling. **The fragmentation of process has made it difficult, if not impossible, to pay attention to the whole in almost all building processes.**  

> Social and industrial processes can, with the right intent, be refashioned to allow feeling to guide and dominate the whole, no matter how impossible that may sound to our cynical contemporary ears.  
> It is worth reflecting on this as a realistic possibility.
