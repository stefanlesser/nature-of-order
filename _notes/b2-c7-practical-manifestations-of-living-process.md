title: "Practical manifestations of living process"

> I emphasize that a living process, as I have described it, is an *idealized* scheme. In the real world of architecture, processes which are living ones do not necessarily resemble the scheme I have described. They are **often more informal, and more ordinary**.  

> My advice would be something modest and practical: *Do one small good thing; then do another small good thing; then do another good thing.* Simple as this is, **focusing on the creation of one good thing at a time, is already likely to work**; it will make the garden better. After a person has grasped that idea, I may then point out that sometimes, the good things that we do work even better if **each small good thing also helps to achieve some slightly larger good thing**.  

> I do not need to mention creation of centers explicitly to have a living process. **The *idea* of creating centers is crucial. The *language* of centers does not have to be used to make it work.**  

> Society, everyday habit, and professional practice are filled with rules, policies, generic processes, and homely bits of advice about process. So long as the ***content* of these processes — not necessarily their verbal form** — makes them living processes, they will help to create living structure in the world.
