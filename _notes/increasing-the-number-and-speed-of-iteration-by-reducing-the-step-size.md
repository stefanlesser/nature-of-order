title: Increasing the number and speed of iteration by reducing the step-size

The key to finding a good sequence is to tighten the feedback loop and get to points of judgement as quickly as possible.

We can achieve that by simulating intermediate results with sketches, models, prototypes, and simulations, before building the real thing. This way, we hopefully spend less time and effort to get to an artifact that provides some of the qualities that the real thing will have (not all of them unfortunately).

At the point of judgement it is important to know what exactly is judged.

If the incentives push us to judge the wrong thing — for instance how profitable a solution is going to be instead how much life it adds to the design — we gradually develop a sequence that is better for achieving that particular goal, but that might take us away from what we were intending to achieve in the first place.
