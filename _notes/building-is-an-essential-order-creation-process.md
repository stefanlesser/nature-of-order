title: Building is an essential order-creation process
---

We have a rudimentary idea of how creation works for:

- new particles through interaction with each other
- living organisms through the morphogenetic process

The process of building is an [[order]]-creating process of equal importance. Understanding how it works is of essential importance for understanding our world.
