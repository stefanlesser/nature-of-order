title: "The significance of generated structure"

> It is the mistake-ridden character of the plans which marks them as fabricated — and that comes from the way they are actually generated, or made, in time. Generated plans have *few* mistakes.  

*What is a mistake in a piece of software (code)?*

> In a mechanical scheme like E, each line has roughly five mistakes associated with it. By that I mean that the line was drawn on a drawing board, **without any opportunity for the line to be modified, or adjusted, according to realistic perception of actual difficulties and opportunities on the place itself**. I claim that in a professional planning/design/development process, this failure of adaptation is inevitable, and that at the time of its creation **no process was put in place to remove these mistakes**.  
> By contrast, in C, I argue that each line represents a decision that was put down, one at a time, over a history extended in time, and that **each decision was made by people associated with the place, the house, the immediate conditions**. As a result of this **relatively slower unfolding process**, and as a result of the **decentralization of the decision-process in different people’s hands and in the hands of people intimately associated with the needs of the situation**, I shall say, further, that at the time the line is put down, each of the five possible mistakes (that existed in E) is here corrected, by adaptation, and that as a result of the process which allows each line to be considered carefully, and adjusted, these five possible mistakes are eliminated.  

> Any process which statically determines these elements (lines, edges, and positions) merely by drawing-board planning, cannot avoid having some 8,000 mistakes.  
> C, on the other hand, has very few mistakes in it — or perhaps, by the same kind of count, at most a few hundred. Thus, the effect of allowing C to grow in time, and to grow gradually, to unfold gradually, is that most of the possible mistakes in it are eliminated, while a designed and planned object such as D will have on the order of 10^4 mistakes in the site plan alone.  
> That is the enormous difference between a generated thing, and a designed and fabricated thing. In a fabricated/designed thing, it is virtually certain that it will have a huge number of mistakes, reducing the value of the environment, and reducing its ability to support people’s daily lives in an efficient and adequate fashion.
