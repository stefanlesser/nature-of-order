> We cannot have our *own* belonging to the world if the buildings we make  do not belong to the land. Their belonging is essential to our belonging, whether in towns or in the country.

> Throughout these five chapters the basic theme is the positive character of living space and the fact that this positive quality of space is the single most important and most tangible result of living processes at work. It is, also, the one that has the greatest effect on our belonging to the world.
