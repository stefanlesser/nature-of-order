title: 1 Every place will be unique
---

> One of the most fundamental aspects of a living world is that every part of it will be unique. If we learn to use a living process well, its most essential nature will be to create structures which are unique, because they are perfectly adapted to their local unique conditions.  
> That means, if a repetitive structure is to be built — a group of houses, say, or a group of offices, a series of windows, even a series of similar office buildings, or a number of private offices — the living process that is used will make each version of the repeating structure *similar*, if that is appropriate — but each repeated unit, each time it occurs, *will be slightly different* according to the unique configuration of circumstances where it occurs.  
> In such a result, inevitably following from a living process, each place, each part has the chance of becoming loved — or anyway, at least it is *possible* to love —because it is entire, particular.  
> This character is familiar and obvious in nature. It happens without effort from us. And in traditional towns and villages, too, it happened without effort because of the naturalness of the unfolding. But in our era, we have yet to learn how to get this particularity, uniqueness, into every part of the built world.  

> Living process, properly understood, is so deeply structure-preserving that every house, every door, every apartment, each room, each corridor, becomes unique in its own terms, because it preserves the structure of the world (which is unique) at that place, and translates the uniqueness of the place into the uniqueness of the thing, the artifact.  
> That can be a world we love.
