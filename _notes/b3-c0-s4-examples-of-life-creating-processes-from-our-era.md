title: Examples of life-creating processes from our era
---

> Obviously, I am not proposing that we go through life repeating this formula each time we do something, **like blind idiots**, just so that we can claim we are doing “a” living process.
> Nevertheless it is true that the processes required to make a living thing are, at some very deep level, always **similar in their essentials**.

### Evolution of a set of drinking glasses: four steps showing a life-creating process extending over a few weeks

> Throughout these steps, I did need to have the ***reality* of centers** in my mind while I was working. But I did not have to talk to myself in the **jargon of centers** to be successful. What actually happens in detail, in different projects, is unendingly varied.

### Construction of a gateway leading to five low-cost houses in Mexico: another small example of a living process

### Construction of an apartment building in downtown Tokyo

### A variety of other processes, all similar in fundamental character

> I rarely talk to myself explicitly about the centers — unless I feel I am going off the track and need to bring myself back on track.

### Design for the interior courtyard of a civic center for the city of Mountain View, California

### Construction of a visitors center in southern England

> Deep down, it it true that in all these varied cases we really need to be occupied with the system of centers and with the feeling of the whole — always. But there is nothing formula-like about the actual activity itself. Each living process, for each new project, is fresh and new.
