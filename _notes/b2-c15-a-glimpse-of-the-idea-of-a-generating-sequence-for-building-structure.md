title: "A glimpse of the idea of a generating sequence for building structure"
---

> Since this aspect of building — the structural grid — is often treated too lightly, and since the sequence of steps I have described catches the important core of architecture in an almost simple way, we have a glimpse here of what I have stated more generally in chapters 6 and 7. Namely, as we pay attention to living process, we shall find various fragments of sequence in which living structure of a building is created by nearly routine application of repeatable steps to an emerging form. These will sometimes provide us with a general method of the utmost importance.  
> We may say that in this case, we have identified a general sequence, which will give us the form of a building, in a powerful and simple fashion, which is repeatable in a wide variety of circumstances.
