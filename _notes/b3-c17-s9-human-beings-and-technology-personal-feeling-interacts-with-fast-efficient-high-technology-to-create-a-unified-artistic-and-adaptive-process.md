> First, the use of computers. The design is sketched out on computer, which allows very great variation to be directly created, without effort, as easily as one can sketch in Photoshop or Paintshop-pro.  
> Second, the computer allows a flexible and free configuration to be created and then provides the means by which this can be transferred to machine control of material. In this case it cuts or configures real marble, real glass, to match the roughly drawn configurations.  

> What is so remarkable about all this is that the subtlety, humanity, and artistic refinement — which was commonplace the 12th century, and which seemed completely out of the question in the 20th century — in the 21st century now comes once again within our grasp in a new form, never dreamed of by the ancients.  
> But what matters, what is most vital, is that these subtleties, in which living structure is created by living processes — albeit living processes of entirely new kinds — can be achieved and living structure attained on a massive scale.
