title: "The vital interplay of form and sequence"

> I do not believe that it is possible to understand the nature of sequence, or the idea of generated structure, if one has not actually constructed a sequence which works.  

> What happens is that as we write the pattern-like entities down, in order, trying to put them in a nice order which will unfold smoothly, we find that we have to keep changing the patterns. Sometimes we have to combine two. Sometimes we have to divide one into two new ones. But more surprising than that, sometimes we find that we are having to invent new patterns altogether.  
> And sometimes, as we work out a smooth sequence that really differentiates space well, step by step, we find that we may altogether change the content or relative weight of one pattern or another, thus, entirely changing the meaning of the form which will be generated, and ultimately even changing the whole form itself.  

> Even a minor change in the sequence changes — not only the effectiveness of the sequence — *but the whole meaning and content of the form itself*.  
> Thus, while we thought we were **merely constructing the tool with which to create or generate the form** of a house, we find that we are **struggling, at every turn, with the form itself** — with the actual form of the houses and buildings and community, even when we are simply working on the structure of the generative sequence.
