title: Contemporary architecture avoids the 15 properties
---

We consciously move away from buildings that exhibit the geometric patterns of the [[15 fundamental properties]] — for no good reason:

> It should be observed that this fact is not neutral with regard to theories of architecture. One cannot help noticing that the buildings of recent decades (1940-90) are noticeably missing in these properties. I believe that this is intentional, and that **various unusual 20th-century theories of architecture have led architects and designers consciously to move away from these properties** in the effort **to promulgate some particular style or intention**. For people who have been brainwashed by these recent theories of design, it may be uncomfortable to confront the factual nature of the fifteen properties. I believe this cannot be helped.
> […]
> 
> The sad truth is that the works of the last fifty years have **consciously abandoned understanding, or use**, of these properties. […] This does not mean that the fifteen properties have anything to do with ancient things as opposed to modern ones. […] The fact that there are relatively fewer examples to be shown from the last seventy years is **not polemical, but merely factual and proportioned**.

*In user interface design, we can find similar fashions driven by the intention to push a certain image and a tendency to avoid guidelines that describe well-working and proven interaction patterns just to do something new or different.*
