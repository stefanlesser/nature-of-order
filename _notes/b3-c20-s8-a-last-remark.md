title: 8 A last remark

> In the best cases, in the cases which have the most life, the building form will most often be interwoven in some fashion with nature itself. In the best cases, it will seem, almost indistinguishably, to be part of nature, thus forming a seamless whole.  
> The clearest way I can say this, is to point out that it will — in this case — seem extremely ordinary. It will appear normal, and be normal. It will, not at all, then, seem like the work of an architect’s hands.  

> Thus the morphogenesis of what is truly living, will have a character that, in our present way of thinking, will hardly look like architecture at all. It will have the structure I have described so many times, the deep morphological and geometric structure — yes. But, we must remember, it is achieved through painstaking attention to the ordinary. It is a precision of fit and harmony in things that comes from intensity of observation.  

> The naturalness, the ordinariness will then place before us, a target, an aim, which is very different from the things that architects have worshipped today and yesterday.  
> Something truly relaxed, truly made for human comfort, truly arising from an egoless and unencumbered wish to make things right, *and nothing more*.
