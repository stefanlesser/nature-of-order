title: Make God appear in the middle of a field
---

A quote from the documentary _Spaces for the Soul_ about Christopher Alexander:

> Alexander: “We’re architects and contractors, build buildings… I think on that level of description is completely ordinary. 
> 
> I suppose the part that isn't is that we're trying to do something that no one else has ever tried to do in the 20th century.”
> 
> Interviewer: “Could you verbalize what that thing is?”
> 
> Alexander: “Well, make God appear in the middle of a field.”
