Update to the model of living structure:

- a system of centers
- each center has some degree of life
- every center is to some degree a picture of the self

> Let us now consider a model that builds on the conception of I. In this model, I consider **living structure** as I have before, as **a system of centers, each center having some different degree of life**. The model is similar to the one presented in Book 1, especially as it is presented in chapters 3 and 4. But I now introduce one very important change. Let us also include the fact that **every center in the system of centers is, to some degree, a picture of the self**.

> In Book 1, we spoke of the **degree of life** which different centers have. That is a **structural matter**. We now add the idea that each center has a **degree of quality**, an **intensity of life** according to the degree in which it is a picture of the self.
> 
> This model is consistent with two propositions which were introduced in Book 1:
> (1) that every living structure contains thousands of living centers, and
> (2) that every living center may be distinguished as living, to the degree that it is a picture of the eternal self.
> But, in Book 1, I did not go on to draw the conclusion that comes from these two propositions.
> 
> When we put these two propositions together, we can hardly avoid reaching the conclusion that *every living structure is composed of thousands of pictures of the eternal self*. In this model, a living structure, is not merely composed of thousands, or millions, of interacting centers. It is, equally, composed of millions of interacting pictures of the “I”.
