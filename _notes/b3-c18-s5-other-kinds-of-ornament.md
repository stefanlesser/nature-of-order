title: 5 Other kinds of ornament

> The ornamental structure most often comes from the material, and from the way a thing is being made.  

> The brick was laid in a diagonal herringbone pattern. This is an old traditional method. But the fundamental idea that an [[alternating repetition]] of this kind is a natural way to embellish a flat rectangular panel comes straight from structure-preserving ideas. On either side of the window opening a latent structure appears which is asymmetrical, pointing away from the window, and upwards. Thus, the morphological field which is there, before the bricks are laid, already points to a structure of this kind. The bricks just implement, embody, that structure. That is why they look harmonious.  
> And the thistle shape we had cut to go above the arch. That is an archetypal center, it has [[good shape]], and many smaller [[strong centers]] within its own perimeter. That is why it strengthens the arch shape, ties it into the horizontal bands of stone and concrete â€” and thus makes [[positive space]]. Again, that is why it looks so harmonious there, because it comes from a structure that was already there, latent, before we invented this embodiment.
