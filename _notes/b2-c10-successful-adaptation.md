title: "Successful adaptation"
---

> Adaptation in a complex system, requires the constant shaping and forming of individual centers, in relation to the whole. The success of the adaptation comes from the freedom which the center-forming process has to make each center strong, to make it centered in relation to other nearby centers. As we have seen, this process is *essentially* and necessarily dynamic. It can only be done, step by step, as the conception of the building, and its details, evolve, in planning, in design, and in construction.  

*Transformations are applicative, but structure-preserving transformations are monadic? Alexander’s process requires step-by-step adaptation, which is only possible if the “data model is piped all the way through”.*
