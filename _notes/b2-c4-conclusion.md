> In a living system what is to be always grows out of what is, supports it, extends it structure smoothly and continuously, elaborates new form — sometimes startling new form — but without ever violating the structure which exists.  

> All in all modern society succeeded, in the last century, in creating an ethos where buildings, plans, objects… are judged only by themselves, and not by the extent to which they enhance and support the world.  

> Creativity comes about when we discover the new within a structure already latent in the present. It is our respect for what is that leads us to the most beautiful discoveries. In art as in architecture, our most intelligent and most wonderful creations come about, when we draw them out as extensions and enhancements of what exists already.
