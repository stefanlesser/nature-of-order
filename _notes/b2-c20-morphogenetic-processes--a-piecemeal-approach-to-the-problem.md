title: "Morphogenetic processes — a piecemeal approach to the problem"

> The present system is massive, powerful, and extremely widespread and entrenched. There is no ‘revolutionary’ approach that has much hope. **The present system cannot be destroyed and replaced**: it is too widely present, and too deeply embedded, in too many institutions. And it is, besides, for all its faults, serving us too well, in too many areas of life, for us to *want* to destroy or replace it.  

*Clearly, he has never met people like Dominic Cummings or Steve Bannon…*

> I take it for granted, therefore, that **the practical means we seek must be gradual, incremental modes of change, which somehow manage to inject living sequences — and morphogenetic ones — into the present system of processes**, in such a way that as deeper and more morphogenetic character gradually gets a foothold, is established, and slowly becomes the norm.
