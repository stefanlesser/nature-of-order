title: "Gradual progress toward living structure"
---

> Possibly the most basic and necessary feature of any living process is the fact that it goes *gradually*. The living structure **emerges, slowly, step by step**, and as the process goes forward step by step there is **continuous feedback** which allows the process to guide the system **towards greater wholeness, and coherence, and adaptation**.  

> Neither the process of design, not the process of construction work like this. Instead there is a conception of **a desired end-state (the design)**, and the system of architectural and constructional processes is **geared up to *producing* this desired end-state, efficiently, and at all costs as it was initially defined** — almost entirely without realistic feedback and improvement and adaptation while the processes are going on.  

> In any case, the core of *all* living process is step-by-step adaptation — the modification and evolution which happen gradually **in response to information about the extent to which all emerging structure supports and embellishes the whole**. *It is a necessary, unavoidable core.*  

> The procedural context in which these giant 20th-century projects were taking place — even the design process itself during its early stages — simply did not permit step-by-step adaptation to occur, not during design, not during construction, nor indeed after construction or during maintenance.
