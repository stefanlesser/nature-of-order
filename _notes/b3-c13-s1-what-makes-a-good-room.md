title: 1 What makes a good room?
---

> When we are indoors, most of the time we are in a room. The peacefulness, the ordinary comfort you feel, your ability to work, to love, to be well â€” these are all affected by the calmness and beauty of the room in which you are. You could reasonably say, therefore, that the rooms where we spend our time, the character of these rooms represents the single most important thing about the built environment. The environment affects us, and it is perhaps through our rooms that is does the most.  

### 4 main stages of unfolding rooms
	1. Position
	2. Contents (main centers)
	3. Fine structure (smaller centers)
	4. Tranquility

> Each room has four main stages to its unfolding. The first concerns its **position**, the second concerns its **contents** and **main centers**, the third concerns its **fine structure** (its **smaller centers**), the fourth concerns its **tranquility**. In a room where true unfolding occurs, these four stages will give the room its life.
