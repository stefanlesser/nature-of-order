title: Character vs. features

<- [[Wholeness]]

Matisse’s face drawings (self-portraits) in chapter 3.11.

Matisse draws himself four times, and each drawing has remarkably different *features*, and yet it is still possible to clearly see that all are **characteristically drawings of him**.

> Character is something deeper than features: it is an inner thing which **exists over and above the features**, and is **not even dependent** on these features.

Local *features* cannot capture *character*. The whole structure can.

> **This “character” is the wholeness.** It is the overall vector, the overall qualitative structure, the overall field effect of the face. It is a global pattern-like aspect of the face which is the same in all four pictures.

*This seems to confirm that the details, and the accuracy of details, is not that important, as long as the overarching structure has the shape that keeps it whole.* -> [[Life and imperfection]]

> You cannot get the portrait of a person right *unless* you can see this underlying wholeness, this underlying inner character. […] If you want to draw a person, you *have* to draw the wholeness. Nothing else will get the likeness.
> 
> In portraiture, as in architecture, it is the wholeness which is **the real thing that lies beneath the surface, and determines everything**.
