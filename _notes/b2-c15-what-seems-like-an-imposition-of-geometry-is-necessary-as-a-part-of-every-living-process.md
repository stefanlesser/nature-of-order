title: "What seems like an imposition of geometry is necessary as a part of every living process"
---

> What I have said applies to buildings. It is the process through which the great volumes and spaces, in their proper hierarchy, are fitted together with small elements, even with the masses of which the walls and stones are made, to arrive at one solid packing that endows its surroundings and its occupants with the presence of a living center.  
> I believe — but am not in a position to affirm with certainty — that a similar “brutal” and purely geometric process always occurs somewhere in other kinds of unfolding that generate living order.  

> I believe the language of this chapter, pretty much as I have written it, applies not only to the construction of small buildings, and great buildings, but also to the emergence of any coherent whole, in almost any medium.  
> Thinking about creation in this way, brutal and too-decisive though it may seem, is the process by which the guts of a thing, its valuable force, is made.
