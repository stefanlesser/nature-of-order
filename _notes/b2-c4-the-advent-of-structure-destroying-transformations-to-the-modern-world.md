> A process of building gradually, with available money (typical in traditional society), was replaced by a process in which buildings were financed with bank loans, thus requiring immediate payback of the interest and capital. This process is the same in a socialist economy, where the government pays back the loan, as it is in a capitalist economy, where private investors pay back the loan but also hope to make further profit. Paying back the loan becomes the underlying process, and the buildings which are created become artifacts charged mainly with the achievement of the loan.
