> The work of creating geometric centers, in a piece of land, is really a ***geometrical*, physical activity**. It has to do with **making things in space** that are really centers. This activity is something so *geometrical*, so *formal*, that it is almost automatic; it is really an artistâ€™s song, a free process or creating geometry like singing in the bath, or letting a line of paint follow the paper.  

*This warrants some further investigation into gestalt psychology and the simple rules of graphic design that make us connect certain arrangements of shapes with each other. It seems that this is what is mostly going on here.*
