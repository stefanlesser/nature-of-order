title: "Minimum symmetry breaking"

> Nature, too, creates beautiful structures which are governed by repeated application of structure-preserving transformations. In this connection, I think it is useful to remark that what I call structure-preserving transformations are very closely related to what has become known as “symmetry breaking” in physics.  

> When something is done to the wholeness, or some effect is introduced, differentiation is created. The particular differentiation which occurs is that one which is most fully structure-preserving. This means that a step forward is taken which leaves intact as much of the structure of centers and symmetries as possible.
