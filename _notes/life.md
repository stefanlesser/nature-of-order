title: Life

Alexander wants to move **from the classic narrow binary definition** of life **to a new broader gradual definition**. He needs a definition that makes it possible to apply it to both alive organisms (in the classic biological sense) as well as any other kind of matter in space. A gradual definition makes that possible.

*It is somewhat problematic that Alexander wants to redefine the existing term “life” (though appropriate), because it conflicts with contemporary common-sense understanding of the word and makes conversations difficult.*

### Understanding life as a structure
Life is a quality of space itself. It is an objectively real physical phenomenon in space which our cognition detects. It applies to every brick, stone, person, and physical structure of any kind that appears in space.

*Alexander is deeply concerned with **finding a good definition** for life, so that we can ask precise questions about what must be done to create it. His goal is **understanding** the interaction of humans and nature and **making a harmony** out of that interaction. He wants to proceed with the general idea that all work has to do with the creation of life and that the task is **to make buildings come to life as much as possible**.*

### Degree of life
Every form of [[order]] has some degree of life.
The particular degree of life that occurs in organisms becomes a special case of a broader conception of life.

Although it is hard to define and describe life, we can sense and feel it, in particular in structures with high or low degrees of life.

*I do understand the need for the gradual and more inclusive definition of life, but I’m not sure how he makes the leap to more life automatically being better. Are there no use cases where the absence of life could be useful?*

### Questions to think about
* Why does it seem to be easier to create life if we don’t think about it too much?
* Are there any cases where a higher degree of life would not be desirable? Is there any use for “dead” structures or are they universally bad?
