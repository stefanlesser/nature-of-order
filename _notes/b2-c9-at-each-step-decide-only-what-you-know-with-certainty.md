title: "At each step decide only what you know with certainty"
---

> As the living process goes forward, repeating the fundamental process again and again, and applying the fifteen transformations as needed, one feature is built up at a time. When we are sure of the first, we add a second. When we are sure of the first and second, we add a third.  
> How do you determine these steps which must be taken, and their sequence? What steps do you take, in what order?   
> The most basic instruction I can give you as a guide for a living process, *is that you move with certainty*. That means, you take small steps, one at a time, *deciding only what you know*. You try never to take a step which is a guess or a “why don’t we try this?” Large-scale trial-and-error, shots in the dark, simply do not work. Rather, you **move by slow, small decisions, deciding one thing, getting sure about it, and then moving on**. When — on the one particular small issue at hand — you feel certain enough that you have it right, *then* you move on to the next small decision.  

> I do not mean that the decisions should be small in physical scale. Rather, I mean that the *content* of each decision should be **limited to a particular subject, to some feature of the design, disconnected from other matters, and floating, to an extent, by itself**.  
>   
> As far as the *scale* of the decisions is concerned — that, on the contrary, should be rather large. **At the beginning, especially, you need to work mainly with the largest questions.** Many of the issues you need to settle, in the early stages of your work, have to do with the whole, the global quality of the design.  

> Each step is, in a sense, a return to the whole and starting over with a “first step”. So, in the same breath, we must recognize that to take a good step, the main problem is to ***avoid* taking any of the many possible false steps**.  

> It is more likely that the first possibilities that present themselves to our minds will be bad ones, rather than good ones. We should therefore **be extremely skeptical about the first possibilities** that present themselves to our minds. We should run through the possibilities very fast, *and reject most of them*. If we do accept one, we should accept it, reluctantly, only when we finally encounter something **for which no good reason presents itself to reject it, which appears genuinely wonderful to us, and which demonstrably makes the feeling of the whole become more profound**.  

> Virtually all the shocking blunders and horrors of modern and postmodern architecture may be understood like this. They turned out bad mainly because they were *unexamined experimentally*. The designer did not take the time to examine the different possible steps in the evolution of the form and, at each step, seek out — with care — *that one of these which has the deepest feeling*: hence which of the possible steps does the most to extend and protect the world in that place.  
> *The vital point is that this is an empirical matter.* **It can be discovered by experiment** (in the real place, or in a model, or in other sufficiently “real” simulations). **But it will not be discovered, unless the experiment is *done*** — through models and in the designer’s mind, while the designer is running through possible steps to take.  
> The one exception occurs when the designer is deeply in touch with the wholeness that is there, and can **summon up, very rapidly, a genuine structure-preserving transformation as an intuitive response** which springs directly from the wholeness, in the designer’s mind.
