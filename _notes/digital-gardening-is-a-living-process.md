* The whole is **continuously enhanced** with any note which is added or edited. When choosing to add new ideas, the whole needs to be considered to find the appropriate place for them.

* Linking notes is like **intensifying centers**: the more a note gets linked to, the stronger it becomes as a center.
* Links between notes are like **latent centers**: sometimes they are strong and immediately visible, sometimes they are hidden and emerge over time.
