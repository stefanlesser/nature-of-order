title: 12 Conclusion
---

> A perfect ease that makes a man or woman perfectly themselves.  
> That, after all, is the goal of our existence. And that, if it can be attained, is the most we can ask of the world: that is support us in this ease.  
> This something, this state, which makes us free, makes us harmonious beings — that is what all of us, as builders, should search for, must search for.  
> That is what each one of us must search for, in the little things we do around our houses, done in such a loose way that it can really allow us to reach and touch the existence of our selves.  

> As architects and builders, it is our responsibility to allow these processes to exist in society at large, to show how they can exist on a large scale. So it is not merely the problem of how it can be done on a small scale that I am asking you to carry in your mind and solve. What we have to solve, ultimately, is the problem of giving the whole Earth that structure which will allow all of us — all of us teeming millions — to **feel the comfort of belonging to the places where we live and work**.
