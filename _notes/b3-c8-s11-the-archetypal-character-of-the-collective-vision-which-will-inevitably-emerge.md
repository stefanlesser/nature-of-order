title: 11 The archetypal character of the collective vision which will inevitably emerge
---

> The collective vision which emerges from a true unfolding process will not be just *any* vision. It would be absurd, for example, for a group of people to decide on the latest image from Time Magazine, and then to declare that *this* was their collective vision.  
> If the vision arrived at from the fundamental process is a true one — truly a *vision* — it will unfold from the people themselves, from their inner desires, from their own true nature. That means it will be a real thing, a real wholeness that is expressedL and insofar as it is a real thing, a *true* wholeness.  
> That means, the collective vision will be a truthful and accurate vision of a living structure, which *really is* a living structure for these people in that place. It is not merely declared to be a living structure. It captures, seizes, the essence of being human there and then, in that place, for those people. It is, if you like, humanity embodied.  

> As such, this collective inspired vision will be recognizable — related, probably, to the material in _A Pattern Language_. It is more likely that it will have the truly living structure which causes people — when in the presence of this structure — to be more deeply conscious of their own feelings, of their own inner aspirations.
