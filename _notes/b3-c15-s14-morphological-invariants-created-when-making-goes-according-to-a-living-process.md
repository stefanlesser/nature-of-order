title: 14 Morphological invariants created when making goes according to a living process
---

> All dimensions and shapes of every element are perfectly adjusted.  
> In a repeating series of details, the individual elements expand and contract according to location in the series. There are not perfect constancies of dimension.  
> General dimensions are repeating. But because elements are placed exactly right, dimensions of location are also unpredictable and variable.  
> Perfection, in the sense of **repetitive exactness**, **accuracy of line** and so on, **is not sought**. Rather, the perfection that is sought is **accuracy of feeling** in the centers that are made.  
> In a technical sense, everything is specially cut and shaped as if it were hand-craft. In practice, though, this hand-craft will often be done by ultramodern, high-technology techniques which allow making in a new technical sense, because our 21st-century techniques allow details to be fitted exactly to their positions in the whole through some new form of almost “biological” process.  
> Even if a building is made with the most sophisticated high-process technology, in every inch its character will always feel hand-made.  
> The love of the material will be visible in every inch.
