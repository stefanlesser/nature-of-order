title: Growing this site
---

I’m trying to *grow* this site, both content and technical features, in a way resembling Alexander’s adaptive process. That means: constantly taking a step back, looking at the whole as it works right now, and then judging what the next most valuable step could be that will make it better.

For now, I want to focus on growing the content and add many more notes and links between them. Yet, there a many things I’d like to change about how this site works.

Below I list ideas, in order of importance/priority, of what I think are useful modifications. Feel free to suggest ideas in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/nature_of_order_chat).

For this technical part, I could use help. This site is Jekyll-based, and hosted with GitHub Pages. If you’re familiar with Jekyll and Ruby, or with HTML and CSS, many of these ideas should be straightforward to implement. You can look at the code at [this site’s GitHub project](https://github.com/stefanlesser/nature-of-order).

What are the technical features (centers) which add the most value to this collection of notes?

### Navigation
* List of recently updated notes on the index page
* List of unconnected notes that don’t have any incoming links
* *I don’t like the graph visualization that much. Not sure it adds value. It came with the template. As several notes aren’t properly linked yet, I’ll leave it in for now.*

### Design
* Footnotes displayed as floats right next to the place where they are referenced in the main text
