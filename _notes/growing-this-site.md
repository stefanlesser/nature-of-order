title: Growing this site
---

I’m trying to *grow* this site in a way that resembles Alexander’s adaptive process — both content and technical features. That means: constantly taking a step back, looking at the whole as it works right now, and then judging what the **next most valuable step** could be that will make it better as a whole.

For now, I want to focus on growing the content and add many more notes and links between them. Yet, there a many things I’d like to change about how this site works.

[[todo|Here]] I list ideas, in order of importance/priority, of what I think are useful modifications to achieve the various [[project objectives|reasons why this site exists]]. Feel free to suggest other ideas in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/nature_of_order_chat).

For this technical part, I could use help. This site is [open source](https://github.com/stefanlesser/nature-of-order), Jekyll-based, and hosted with GitHub Pages. If you’re familiar with Jekyll and Ruby, or with HTML and CSS, many of these ideas should be straightforward to implement.
