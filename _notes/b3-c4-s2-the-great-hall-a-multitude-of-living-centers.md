title: "2 The Great Hall: a multitude of living centers"
---

> What is the essence of the way to make a large building *in the context of living process*?  

> *Everything you make must be a being.* A “being” is another way of talking about a living center: it refers to the emotional aspect of a center when it is genuinely endowed with life. […] It seems to have a presence… something almost like a living being.  

> The presence of living centers throughout its fabric — requires forms of management, forms of contract administration, forms of construction, which allow the focus of the entire operation to be on this living quality, day-in, day-out, while the building is being made — while it is first conceived, while it is planned in detail, while it is being built.  
> Day-in, day-out, the construction of living centers is going forward, and the entire management process is focused and arranged to make this possible.  

> The effect of the living centers, both their profusion and their unity, which makes the largest whole a living center too, is to bring nourishing life — real life — to the community and to its individuals.
