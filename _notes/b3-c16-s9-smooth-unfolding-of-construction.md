title: 9 Smooth unfolding of construction
---

> In present-day building techniques, the process of construction is not smooth. One works with a drawing of the building, a drawing which shows how each part fits together, and this shows where each component, and each contractor, are supposed to fit in.  
> One of the reasons for the complex drawings of our time is that these different techniques and subcontracts need to be coordinated. It is vital to coordinate them accurately. If the drawings do not show where each part goes, it cannot be done.  

> But *unfolding* — the unfolding of a living process — is not like that at all. […] The process goes from one step to the next, and the final result is determined by the *process*, not by a drawing. This is what allows the smoothness of the adaptation, the excellence of the unfolding, and the beauty of form.
