> The positive feeling I have described does not come merely from the activity of making. It comes about only when the field of living centers is actually *achieved*.
> 
> Indeed, cases of making where living structure is *not* achieved have a tense, unresolved feeling associated with them, that is more like frustration than satisfaction, even when a thing is actually made and finished.
