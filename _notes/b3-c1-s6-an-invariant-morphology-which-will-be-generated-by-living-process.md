> And the focused gathering of human groups in public spaces, **the expression of the larger which supports the smaller, is a necessary larger level of structure in all nature** â€” as vital to the dwelling in our habitat as the mother to the baby, or as the river to the stream, or as the ocean to the iceberg.
