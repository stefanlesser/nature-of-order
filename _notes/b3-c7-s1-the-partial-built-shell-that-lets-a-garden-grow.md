title: 1 The partial, built shell that lets a garden grow
---

> Whether in public gardens, or in private gardens, the quality of exterior space which comes from living process has a particular and definable morphology. […] Simple, and nearly crude, only the essentials are present. Nature dominates, but within a structure roughly made, by geometric centers of construction — concrete, stone — which supply the infrastructure that allows the plants, trees, bushes, water, to find their place.  
> That is the essence of all gardens and all agriculture: that **built materials, human-made structures create a setting in which people, animals and plants can thrive**. It is the geometry of these built structures, which, like the shell of a mollusc, makes the growing of the garden, and its resulting richness, possible.
