title: 5 The spine structure of the Eishin campus
---

> The hulls provide the campus its core, in which people feel at home, and against which, later, they designed and we built, the individual buildings of the campus.  
> The unfolding which took place in this project was that, first, a system of public space was identified, and then we tried to make sure that every part of the Eishin campus came into being and was related to the land by structure-preserving transformations.  
> The success of this world is, in my view, entirely given by the beauty of the hulls, the public hulls we identified and built. They create a world where people enjoy walking about: bridges, paths, avenues of trees, gates, gardens, doorways, stairs: it is a connected world, not kept too isolated from cars, but still a protected and peaceful world which works.
