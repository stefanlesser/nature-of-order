title: "The social and monetary cost of the one million mistakes in a fabricated community"

> Although any one of the mistakes by itself is not strongly noticeable, still, the presence of mistakes add up rapidly, and their *absence* controls the monetary value of a building. If the windows are nicely proportioned, the house becomes more expensive. If the window sills are good, the windows, and the rooms are worth a little more. If the windows look towards beautiful views (a function of the window placement, not only of the potential for view that is inherent in the land), the house is worth a lot more money, often as much as $10-20,000 more.  

> Some mistakes are more costly than others.  

*Ok, these “business-case” calculations are a little… weird. I understand why Alexander brings this up — it certainly is a way to reach his target audience of architects and developers stuck in a process that is mainly based in commercial success of a building.*
