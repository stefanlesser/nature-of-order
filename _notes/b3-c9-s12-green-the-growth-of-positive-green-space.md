title: "12 Green: the growth of positive green space"

> Every garden should create space with both holds us and connects us. This vision of positive outdoor space is almost more important than the buildings themselves.  
> Land is subdivided into individual properties. The best land on each property should be laid out as a garden first, then buildings fill in the space left over. Outdoor space is made positive before a building is designed. The resulting gardens become the fabric holding the neighborhood together. A public space laid out during the initial transformations may be enhanced by the addition of adjacent private spaces. Private gardens add to the life of public outdoor space.
