title: "Uniqueness of different apartment buildings generated by the sequence"
---

> The buildings show a surprising variety, all containing the same key invariant features specified by the generating sequence, but nevertheless each unique according to its context.  
> Dimensional factors are interesting. There is no hint of modular rearrangement in these designs. Rather, the building widths and configurations are pushed, pulled, squeezed, to form well-adapted structures for the conditions that exist on each lot. The variety which occurs, rather more like true organic variety, shows each one as unusual, with its own presence and its own life. In form, these buildings are less like typical apartment buildings of the late 20th-century era, and — at least in this one respect — slightly reminiscent of buildings in various traditional societies.  

*What would a programming environment be like, that doesn’t encourage re-use and modularization, and instead supports maximal adaptation?*

> Although the generative sequence itself is fixed (and needs to be fixed in order to embody the dictates of the fundamental process), the variety this sequence generates, when interacting with a variety of contexts, is very great indeed — indeed, it is essentially infinite.
