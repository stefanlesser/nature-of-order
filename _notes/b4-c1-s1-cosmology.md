> That cannot be done by wiping away the science and technology we have gained. They are too beautiful, too powerful. We have learned too much from them, and gained too much. But somehow, the abstract mechanism-inspired world-picture must be modified, transformed, in such a way that it becomes something that has meaning for all of us.
