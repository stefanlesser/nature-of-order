title: 10 Small and large centers contribute to unfolding
---

> Oddly, the wildness of an unfolded garden does not become most natural without support.  
> It becomes most vivid, when supported by a delicate system of small walls, edges, terraces, trellised structure, small retaining walls, sheds, which refer to centers that are in the land and have been formed by structures built before â€” so that the most natural life can then emerge.  
> The loosely, carefully made centers are the core of our architectural work in the outdoor world because they loosen, let loose, what is seeking to happen there, as if of its own accord.
