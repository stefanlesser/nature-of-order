title: 11 Matura as an example
---

> The Matura company, founded by Professor John Habraken, was dedicated to the proposition that two parts of an apartment building must be separated:  
> (1) the shell of the building, containing foundations, walls, windows, roof, floors and  
> (2) the interiors of the apartments.  

> Interesting though it was, Matura was flawed. The need to prefabricate all the components and then finally, “assemble” them, left too little room for fine tuning and adaptation at the smaller scales. We have now adopted a process in which details are specified by *process descriptions*, allowing each part to be formed uniquely, according to its context, without drawings, using only specification of procedure.
