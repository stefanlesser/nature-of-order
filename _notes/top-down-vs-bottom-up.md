title: Top-down vs. bottom-up — whole vs. parts
---

In the beginning, I was approaching *The Nature of Order* with this question in mind: "Is this theory a **top-down** or is it a **bottom-up** approach?”. Some aspects look clearly like a top-down approach. You keep looking at the whole and differentiate the parts more and more. But other aspects look more like bottom up: you take one step at a time, making decisions based on the current environment. 

When Alexander later talks about the unfolding process and even more specifically in Book 3 about how to "reconcile two systems" of solids and voids or matter and space and achieve deep interlock between them, it became clear to me that he is talking about **both at the same time**. 

Splitting solutions into either "top-down" or "bottom-up" is an analytical step itself deeply rooted in the [[Mechanical-rationalist world view|mechanical worldview]] that everything is a machine-like mechanism that can be broken down into parts to be better understood, or organized into [[Binary vs. gradual perspectives — from boundaries to centers|distinct categories]] which allow us to focus on parts in isolation.

Alexander's critique applies to something rather specific such as building as much as it does to the meta-level of cognition and sense-making.
