title: 3 A house for Geoffrey and Linda Gioja

> Q: We are walking across the site, towards your house. Now, tell me, how do we come into the house, where are we coming from?  

> Q: So now I come to the door. What happens as I go inside, what is the first thing I see, where are we, what are we looking at?  

*If I try to translate these questions to a software unfolding process, this feels like asking mostly about user flows and user interface — how do you want to navigate through the app and what does the app look like? What’s the mental model of the app’s user interface? That is something where geometry exists and is important, as we relate to the spatial features of the interface and its physicality. [[Breadboarding]] is a great tool to document the answers to questions like this. (Alexander sketches rough plans after the phone calls.)*
