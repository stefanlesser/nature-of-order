title: "Difficulties of sequence caused by separating design from construction"
---

> The way that sensible adherence to a sequence of unfolding, is likely to impact real social processes, is nowhere more clear than in the relation between design and construction.   
> In conventional 20th-century process, most people made the assumption that design and construction *can* be separated successfully, and *should* be separated, that design comes first, ending with preparation of detailed construction drawings, and is then followed by a construction process which executes the design specified by the drawing.  
> If we pay attention to the sequence of unfolding as it actually needs to happen, and to the formation of living centers from the whole in a way which enhances the whole, we find ourselves repeatedly in the circumstances where we *must* jump back and forth between the two. [â€¦]  
> We find that a step in the design cannot be taken responsibly, without first taking a step in construction; or a step in construction cannot responsibly be taken, without taking a step in design.  

> Thus, in as living process, design steps and construction steps *must* be interleaved and entangled. The idea that they can be sharply separated as they were in much of the 20th century, does enormous violence to the needs of living structure.  
> On the other hand, careful attention to the natural sequence of events in a living process that is truly capable of creating a good building leads inevitably to a form of process (and social organization) in which these two are entwined.
