title: 4 It unfolds directly from people’s ordinary instincts
---

> In the unfolding, the structure comes most easily from the *true* feeling of people themselves as they are living there.  
> This is one meaning of the fundamental process which is essential, and which has almost the greatest opportunity to flourish in the garden.  
> When we follow the fundamental process, we ty to make, at each step, a real living center. This means we must concentrate on it, and put in a center which we feel something deep about, something we really care about. If this is done, we get a trace of this real feeling in every pothole of the place. Then there is nothing else, only this trace of real feeling, left in every center of the structure. The structure begins to have a meaning!  

> If you do one thing at a time — just a true thing that comes from a carefully considered feeling — that means, when you do it, your own feeling is enormously increased, and you choose it because of that, and you put it there because of that… then something real, ordinary real life, will come into being there.  

> Living process in a garden depends on people following their own hearts, allowing the call of their own hearts, dreams, feeling, to become actual in that place.
