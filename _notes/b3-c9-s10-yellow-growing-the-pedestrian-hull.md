title: "10 Yellow: growing the pedestrian hull"
---

> The pedestrian hull — a linked system of pedestrian areas — needs, at least in part, to be laid down in advance and understood and agreed upon by people in the neighborhood. It will be a composite structure including some parts of existing streets, maybe including some back alleys.  
> In places where derelict land exists, a few small pieces of right of way may need to be bought or donated as easements. Provisions must exist in zoning so that these donations or dedications do not penalize but help the owners who are willing to do it by giving them a bonus in what they are allowed to build. There needs to be a lessening of restriction on their lots, as a reward, and certainty that they can have as much, or more, than they had before.
