### Atoms and bits: what can we build?
> Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the elementary particles and forces, and we're getting increasingly good at manipulating matter. And so we're beginning to ask: **what can we build, in principle?** Not just in a practical sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but **in a fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?**
> 
> Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what Turing and company did for computation? **Can we invent new high-level abstractions and design principles for matter**, similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for computing? What design space is opened up when we control matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What beautiful new design ideas are possible?

### Explore strange things; find them on maps
> The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to guide research: “In any field, **find the strangest thing and explore it**”. One great thing about **maps** is that they **suggest strange things**.

Maps are incredibly useful. I suppose the fact that they help us arrange ideas spatially has to do with it, especially if position has meaning. Think geographic map over a typical diagram of a software system: if you change the position of a city, either your map is wrong afterwards, or something remarkable happened in the real world. Moving things around in your typical boxes-and-arrows diagram doesn’t change anything, perhaps makes it a little easier to read.

### Process > observation
> It’s easier for us to cross-link, fragment and sequence a full genome to figure out its 3-dimensional structure than it is for us to figure that out by looking at it head-on. **We used to rely on photons and electrons bouncing off of biological sample to tell us what was going on down there. Now we’re asking biology directly** - and often the information we get back comes through a natural biological reagent like DNA. Which we then sequence using motors made from the DNA itself!

We like to think of process and result as simple linear chains of cause and effect. But process and result are fascinatingly intertwined. Observing a result is a process. Almost anything we consider result is in fact a process frozen in time. And sometimes the structure of a result is too difficult to grasp, but the process creating that result might be surprisingly simple to describe.

### What is design?
> Many non-designers think of design as relatively unimportant. Once on Twitter an experienced programmer and manager made the following comment about design in the software realm:
> 
> > Honestly, I have a hard time taking the idea of a “Designer” as a whole job seriously. Like you lay out buttons and text? That's it?
> 
> Now, what does it mean that (visual) design is “lay[ing] out buttons and text”? It seems a little like claiming that Shakespeare was merely laying out letters of the alphabet in a particularly well-chosen fashion. There is some sense in which that's true. But the point of design, as with Shakespeare and great writing, is to discover powerful higher-order ideas. Those ideas are then reflected in the layout. In fact, the very best designers invent amazing new abstractions. This is true in both the physical world and the software world.

In the spirit of Alexander: Design is about arranging things. Putting them into “the right” or “a good” order. Design is ultimately about figuring out good arrangements of elements (the building blocks). Arrangements which have some kind of higher meaning to us.

### Large structures out of little material
> Consider Alan Kay (in [A Conversation with Alan Kay (2004)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523)) on the importance of powerful design ideas in physical construction:
> 
> If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering, it’s certainly engineering of a sort—but it’s the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did. Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
> 
> I would compare the Smalltalk stuff that we did in the ’70s with something like a Gothic cathedral. We had two ideas, really. One of them we got from Lisp: late binding. The other one was the idea of objects. Those gave us something a little bit like the arch, so we were able to **make complex, seemingly large structures out of very little material**, but I wouldn’t put us much past the engineering of 1,000 years ago.

### A shift in viewpoint in design
> Kitaev's idea is shockingly audacious and technically brilliant, but it's also merely part of a broader shift to a design point of view in the foundations of physics. Outside physics, this design point of view is of course already present in many parts of science – the synthesis of drugs by chemists is one example. And, of course, it's at the heart of much engineering and invention. What I'm emphasizing here, though, is **the shift in viewpoint from design within some extant realm of available materials and tools, to design which takes as its starting point the fundamental laws of the universe**.

-> Reasoning from first principles.

### Active, imaginative emergence
> Put another way: the conventional use of **“emergent” has a rather passive flavour**. What I'm talking about is a much more active imaginative stance, the kind of stance taken by people like Bret Victor or Satoshi or Picasso.
> 
> Over the long term, I believe there's a fair chance **physics will end up principally as a design science**: really about developing new levels of abstraction in the physical world. People like Kitaev, Wilczek, and even John von Neumann (with his work on cellular automata, universal constructors, and self-replication) will all look to have been working on taking first steps up from the fundamental laws. They're understanding what qualities it is possible to build into matter, understanding if there are composable abstractions, and so on.
> 
> This shift of point of view changes our relationship to matter to what Herb Simon called the “sciences of the artificial”. I believe that retrospectively it'll be viewed as one of the most important shifts in science in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Seems connected with <http://www.jfsowa.com/logic/theories.htm>, in particular the “direction” in which to traverse the _lattice of theories_ and therefore which _revision operators_ to apply.

### Pretty and usable
> Part of the trouble is that the word “design” is often used to mean essentially “making things pretty” or “making things useable”.
> 
> Those are valuable endeavours, but they're not what I mean.

In Alexander’s way of thinking, “pretty” and “usable” aren’t as disconnected from what he’s after and could serve as valuable intuitive indicators for something profound. Not in the “Designer, make this prettier” sense, of course, but it seems we humans have a capacity to detect beauty, which could be a shorthand to intuitively see complex systems as coherent before we can intellectually explain why they are coherent. And, as Alexander explains in Book 2, as a guiding principle for design in the form of an adaptive process of unfolding towards such a coherent whole.

> At its deepest, design is about **inventing entirely new types of objects and of actions**. It's the type of thinking that results in someone conjuring up the rules of chess; or inventing topological quantum computing; or in developing the polymerase chain reaction. In each case we take the rules of reality and find latent within them some other very different set of rules, a set of rules for a new reality, one that generates beautiful patterns of its own.

Taking unexplored branches on the design tree through solution space.

> I first got seriously interested in design after seeing Bret Victor's work in 2012, and thinking “I want to do that”. But also, at the same time: “what is he actually doing?” I then spent many years trying to understand how designers invent powerful new objects and actions and abstractions. (A partial summary of my thinking may be found in [Thought as a Technology (2016)](http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/).) It was far more difficult than I anticipated; I now believe it's one of the hardest and deepest things human beings do, and currently only a handful of people in the world are really good at it. Furthermore, it's a skill almost entirely different from the skills scientists usually learn. (There is, however, some considerable overlap with mathematics, especially the art of finding fundamental new mathematical definitions.)

I’d say Alexander’s _The Nature of Order_ might qualify as an exploration of such a description of a design process.

### Invent or create?
> Are powerful design ideas invented or created? Certainly, they're not arbitrary. They're much more like mathematics: we have a set of basic rules, and can then discover powerful patterns latent in those rules. In that sense we may call it Plato's design flywheel, or the flywheel of design imagination*: we start with the basic laws governing matter, and explore around them, eventually developing powerful new principles. Those, in turns, open up new worlds to explore. And, in my opinion, it's quite likely that will happen in an open-ended fashion, an endless frontier of new worlds.
> 
> *) I realize I'm leaning heavily on the flywheel analogy in these notes – flywheels here, flywheels there, flywheels everywhere. It's perhaps a geographic hazard – I live in Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs and investors are obsessed with finding flywheels to generate growth. Still, the discovery flywheel is a genuine pattern in science, and a useful pattern to be on the lookout for. But it's still just one heuristic for how discovery works, and there are many other powerful heuristics.

Powerful ideas aren’t invented or created, but they are grown as part of a generative and adaptive process. The “lightbulb” moments get most of the attention, but most serious thinkers know that a lot of work goes into it before the lightbulb goes off.

### Nature’s “technique” is limited (and that’s great)
> It's the selection (and variational) pressures acting on the phylogenetic tree which separate biology from other matter. You can view the complete phylogenetic tree – the tree of life – as a way of boldly exploring the space of matter. It's not the complete space, but it is a very large and interesting space*. Do this kind of exploration for a few billion years and you can explore a lot!
> 
> *) Indeed, there's some sense in which whatever human beings ultimately make is a product of the phylogeny, although it would be a stretch to say it should appear on the tree of life. Insofar as human beings obtain universal control over matter, the tree of life may be (loosely) regarded as exploring the entire space of matter.

This corresponds well to Alexander’s observation that living organisms, and nature in general, produces living structure — structure that have a high degree of life in them — through adaptive processes. 

Nature “doesn’t know” how to arrange things arbitrarily (like we humans do), and is “limited” to arrange things using adaptive processes based on the laws and rules of physics, chemistry, and biology.

Alexander, however, would consider a rock to have living structure too. And rocks clearly look natural to us, as if they were made by nature, made by adaptive processes, which they have been.

We humans have the capacity to arrange things (and perhaps soon all the atoms) arbitrarily. That gives us access to a much larger solution space of matter arranged in specific ways. Many of these configurations are unstable. Many won’t turn out as particularly useful. Some of them might be useful. And just a few will be extraordinary discoveries. The latter, rarer versions are what Alexander is striving for in designing buildings. 

Our capability to explore parts of the design tree that nature cannot, might not be the blessing we think it is, but rather a curse.

### Our own importance
> One beautiful thing in this phylogeny: humanity barely shows up. We humans are, in fact, inside the opisthokont clade, itself a single point in the bottom right. That single point includes not just human beings, but all animals, and even the fungi (which are more closely related to animals than they are to plants). In the tree of life, the 100 or so billion human beings who have ever lived are barely visible. Carl Sagan has spoken movingly of the “pale blue dot”, emphasizing the smallness of earth and humanity when viewed in cosmological terms, “a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark”. **We humans are, equally well, a pale point of genetic possibility, a tiny leaf on the immense tree of life.**

Hits right home with Alexander’s criticism on how mechanistic science somehow always ends up telling us how unimportant we are — the collapse of meaning.

### Science works like a TARDIS
> In fact, the TARDIS is really a machine able to bend time and space. And among its many qualities, it's “bigger on the inside than on the outside”*. And so the interior contains all sorts of control rooms, bedrooms, even a swimming pool.
> 
> Science works surprisingly similarly. Apparently **tiny innocuous details sometimes open up to yield beautiful, broadly applicable principles**.
> 
> *) I must admire the Dr. Who scriptwriters' ability to save money on exterior location shots, incidentally coming up with a beautifully generative driver of clever plot points.

### Higher-order principles
> To know the fundamental laws of nature without understanding the extraordinary principles hidden within them seems lame. It would be like knowing the rules of chess – the basic moves which the pieces may make – without understanding any of the higher-order principles which govern the game. It's in the latter, in both chess and science, that the most interest lies. And that is particularly true of those **higher-order principles** which **are in considerable degree decoupled from the underlying laws**.

What Alexander really means when he talks about *patterns*.

### Four dichotomies
> In particular, four dichotomies underlay much of the discussion: between stable and unstable matter; between equilibrium and non-equilibrium matter; between biological and non-biological matter; and between designer and naturalistic matter*.
> 
> *) I can't help but ponder the management consulting question: what happens when you make up two-by-twos from these? I've done so, and then tried putting different types of matter in different quadrants. The results are strangely compelling, though I'm not yet quite sure what to make of them.

*I would love to see these 2-by-2s.*

Some thoughts on the four dichotomies:

* Stable/unstable and equilibrium/non-equilibrium: They both express how stable either the result of a process or the process itself is. Seems connected to how “useful” or “relevant” either is.
* designed/naturalistic: Alexander breaks this apart and it boils down to arranged by a human (with little regard for living structure) vs. living structure that results from an adaptive process
* biological/non-bological: deeply rooted in the mechanist world view this dichotomy seem to make much less sense in Alexander’s framework. In a way, folds into the designed/naturalistic dichotomy (or the other way around).

### Conway’s Law
> In software engineering there is an observation known as Conway's Law (Melvin E. Conway, How Do Committees Invent? (1967), applicable to organizations that design systems:
> 
> Any organization that designs a system... will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

It just occurred to me that one could say that this applies to nature just as well.

> You see this in the fact that our maps of matter are not just maps of nature; they're also maps of the human social organization of science. You see this, for instance, in the periodic table: there are scientific groups which are experts on particular columns of the periodic table, say, the halogens. This social division of labour reflects an underlying principle in nature. Certain principles govern the halogens which aren't operable for other elements; the groups can leverage those principles to develop a particular type of expertise. In a similar way, the tree of life reflects both nature and the human social organization of science: the principles which separate (say) plants on the tree of life are also leverage points for a division of labour.
> 
> Every once in a while, of course, we re-organize these maps as we change our understanding of the underlying principles. 

If Alexander is right and everything is about how it’s arranged, about its geometric structure, then of course Conway’s Law (and its equivalents in other fields) must be fundamental.

Perhaps *understanding* is nothing more than fully grasping the structure of something. That’s why we *re-arrange* our maps when a new insight comes along.

If we understand the structure of a system well enough, we can describe its function and predict its behavior, nothing mystical is left about it (and if there is, we might not realize it, thinking we understand it fully when we don’t).

Enlightenment, then, can be a state where “everything makes sense”. “Everything”, in this case, could still mean anything from everything within the bounds of the unchallenged horizon of a limited world view (e.g. fundamentalist religion), an elegant simplified whole of what you consider relevant (more of a Zen Buddhism kind of approach) or literally everything we can observe (the approach of science).
