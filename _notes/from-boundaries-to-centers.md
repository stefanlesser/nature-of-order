title: Binary vs. gradual perspectives — from boundaries to centers
---

Humans like to put things in categories: something either belongs into a category, or it doesn’t. Yes or no. This **binary perspective** gets in the way when reading Alexander. Many of his ideas go beyond a simplistic binary view of “either, or”, and acknowledge that it is often fuzzy and blurry to put a thing into one category or another. However, there are still things we can clearly classify. Often they are those we can easily give a name.

That’s why Alexander introduces the concept of a [[center]]. To define what’s in and what isn’t in a category, you need a **clear boundary**. By introducing centers, Alexander shifts focus from a boundary to a **strong center** instead.

Somewhere in the periphery of that center there might still be a more or less clearly distinguishable boundary, but that is no longer important. What is important is that you can see the center clearly, whether or not a boundary is visible.

This turns the binary perspective into a **gradual perspective**. It turns a matter of either-or into a matter of degree. Something can be more or less clearly a center. Less clear means: harder to see, weak, latent centers. More clear means: easy to spot, strong, defining centers. 

The gradual perspective also makes it possible to relate other entities to a center in a gradual way: an entity can be “closer” to a center, or more strongly connected, than another.

This resolves the need to pick a category from a limited set of options and introduces a fuzzy gray area between two obvious extremes. We no longer have to agree on the same thing. Instead, we can discuss to which degree something falls on a spectrum between two extremes. Which in turn means we can also be more flexible on the level of precision we require for agreement.

### Connection to cognitive science
This maps neatly to embodied schemas (kinesthetic image schemas) from cognitive science — fundamental building blocks of thought that shine through in language and have been extensively researched in linguistics.
