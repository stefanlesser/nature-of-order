title: 3 The fifteen properties
---

The essence of true belonging is [[Not-separateness]] between us and our world.

> Each of the fifteen properties, in one way or another, comes into play, helping to create true comfort, and giving us the underpinning for this wholesome ordinary existence which makes life worthwhile.  

The structure-preserving transformations generate these properties in real places and create the possibility of life, and the possibility of our true connection to our surroundings. These transformations preserve the wholeness of the world, inject into it (while preserving it) those fifteen properties which sustain life, and create life, and which provide us with a matrix in which our deeper life may come into being.
