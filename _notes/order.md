[[Building is an essential order-creation process|We’re responsible for the creation of order]] on an enormous scale, yet we don’t really know that “order” means, precisely.  We don’t know:

- what it is
- why we are doing it
- what its significance might be

Order usually stands for “some **deep regularity** we [[Order is difficult to describe|cannot quite define]]”.

> We need a better understanding of the **deep geometric reality** of order.

### Definition
Order
: The most general system of mathematical structures that arises because of the nature of space.

There is a way of understanding order which is:

- general
- does justice to the nature of building and architecture
- adequate to understanding the intuitions we have about beauty and the life of buildings
- telling us what it means for a building to be a great building and when a building is working properly
- a common-sense and powerful view, with practical results
- full of unexpected intellectual results
