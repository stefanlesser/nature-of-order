[[Building is an essential order-creation process|We’re responsible for the creation of order]] on an enormous scale, yet we don’t really know that “order” means, precisely.  

We don’t know:

- what it is
- why we are doing it
- what its significance might be

> We need a better understanding of the **deep geometric reality** of order.

Order usually stands for “some **deep geometric regularity** we [[Order is difficult to describe|cannot quite define]]”, which is rooted in the sense that [[arrangement in space is fundamental to how we understand our world]].

### Definition
Order
: The most general system of mathematical structures that arises because of the nature of space.

_The Nature of Order_ presents a way of understanding order which:

- is general
- does justice to the nature of building and architecture
- is adequate to understand the intuitions we have about beauty and the life of buildings
- tells us what it means for a building to be a great building and when a building is functioning properly
- is a common-sense and powerful view, with practical results
- is full of unexpected intellectual results
