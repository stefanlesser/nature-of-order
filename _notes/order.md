[[Building is an essential order-creation process|We’re responsible for the creation of order]] on an enormous scale, yet we don’t really know that “order” means, precisely.  We don’t know:

- what it is
- why we are doing it
- what its significance might be

Order usually stands for “some **deep regularity** we cannot quite define”.

> We need a better understanding of the **deep geometric reality** of order.
