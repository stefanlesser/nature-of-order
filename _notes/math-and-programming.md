title: Math and programming

Several perspectives on the differences between math and programming:

> There is a considerable difference between a mathematician’s view of the world and a computer-scientist’s. To a mathematician all structures are static: they have always been and will always be; the only time dependence is that we just haven’t discovered them all yet. The computer scientist is concerned with (and fascinated by) the continuous creation, combination, separation and destruction of structures: time is of the essence. In the hands of a mathematician, the Peano axioms create the integers without reference to time, but if a computer scientist uses them to implement integer addition, he finds they describe a very slow process, which is why he will be looking for a more efficient approach. In this respect the computer scientist has more in common with the physicist and the chemist; like these, he cannot do without a solid basis in several branches of applied mathematics, but, like these, he is willing (and often virtually obliged) to take on faith certain theorems handed to him by the mathematician. Without the rigor of mathematics all science would collapse, but not all inhabitants of a building need to know all the spars and girders that keep it upright. Factoring off certain detailed knowledge to specialists reduces the intellectual complexity of a task, which is one of the things computer science is about.

> The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology – the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”

> Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

> A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.
