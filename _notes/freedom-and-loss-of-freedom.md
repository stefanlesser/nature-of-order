title: Freedom and loss of freedom
---

> True freedom lies in the ability a person has to react *appropriately* to any given circumstance. The perfectly free human being is a person who, no matter what he or she encounters, can act appropriately.
> 
> And what is *lack* of freedom? Anything which causes a blockage of this ability to react appropriately — whether it be internal obsessions or mental rigidity, or a political system, or the bars of a cage — causes loss of freedom. Lack of freedom is **loss, from whatever source, internal or external, of the ability to act appropriately**.
