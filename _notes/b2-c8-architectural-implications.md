title: "Architectural implications"

> It is the lack of continuous responses to reality which makes the process used by big commercial offices highly vulnerable, and which makes it — inevitably — unsuccessful.  

> That is the idea we must aspire to in architecture. We must imagine a world where, whether it is a building, or a street, or a room, or a bridge, the conception, design, and the construction — and ultimately the maintenance too — go forward in very small steps with feedback, so that they can be corrected. It is this self-correcting aspect of the building process which has all but vanished in recent times.  

> We must reject the statist conception in which the future is planned now, and embrace a new world of architectural design in which the future of each building is not known, remains open to experiment and change, and above all to success.
