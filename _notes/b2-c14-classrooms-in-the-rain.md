> If I repeat the process of relying on feeling again and again, gradually I do get something which has life. The proof of the pudding is that the life generates deep feeling within *me* — a profound kind of ease.  
> What is responsible for this kind of ease?  
> The subtle details of human experience must be accommodated. Yet though they are subtle, they are extremely specific. We feel them strongly. And they do actually exist in the reality of the events which will happen there, practical physical events, and emotional events.  

> These so-called anomalies come about for practical reasons that allow them to be true to the unity of their situation. They are a little strange, occasionally. But the strangeness bothers almost no one, because, what is more important, we sense and feel and experience their commitment to *life*.  

> The main lesson is to gain a greater sense of perspective, in which feeling has its place, and practical issues about getting wet and keeping dry also have their place. It is *feeling*, above all, which has the greatest chance of dealing with the whole in a balanced way, because **it is precisely the nature of feeling that it does embrace the whole — while intellectual ideas more often concentrate on parts and end up getting them out of proportion**.  
> What is most important is the feeling, the life one experiences there. You consider them charming and never dwell on or exaggerate possible functional problems. But, for people educated in the functional architecture of the 20th century, it is the tyranny of functional problems, created by a rigid frame of mind, which exaggerates some things, and then makes it impossible to get the feeling of the wholeness right.
