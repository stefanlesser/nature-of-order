I’m not aware of any direct connection between Christopher Alexander and the way Apple does design and creates products. Sure, back in the 1980s, it’s almost guaranteed that many of the people important to Apple’s history and involved in building the Macintosh were likely influenced by Alexander’s _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, which was a well-known book in the early software industry at that time and was circulated among engineers.

It would be great to hear more stories from that time about Alexander’s connection to and influence on the early tech industry forming in Silicon Valley.

And yet, Apple’s success is partially based in following many of Alexander’s principles. I’m not sure if that really is by design, and I doubt it. It feels more like a co-evolved design process that developed independently and arrived at similar conclusions Alexander did.

Here are a few connections I see:

* Lots of prototypes, feedback from demos -> Book: Creative Selection, Ken Kocienda
* The description of work done in the San Jose memorandum (Book 3, chapter 4, section 11) reads a lot like what Apple does in the design process — countless little details, prototyped and tested again and again, until they feel right.
* Teams are kept small. Larger teams would introduce too much friction for coordination. Naturally, mechanization of processes would occur. New hires starting at Apple are often surprised about how few processes are in place and how independent individuals and teams can — and are expected — to act.
* Engineering managers have engineering backgrounds. There are no career managers managing people without deep understanding for what the work is about.
* The squircles came originally from hardware design. Classic rounded borders are a combination of curves based on circles in the corners connected with straight lines in between. At the point where the straight edge of one side transitions into the arc of the circle in the corner, the curvature suddenly increases. Depending on the physical material used, this can be noticed in light reflections. Squircles avoid this problem with a continuously transitioning angle at that point — a detail that *feels* better in the resulting product.
* Vertical integration: Apple tries to get full control over the most important components that go into their products. That is like Alexander requesting that you can’t just design a building, but you have to know exactly how to build it. It seems a little off with Apple in fact having contractors manufacturing all their devices, but they do heavily influence that manufacturing process up to the point where they invent the machines that are part of it.
* Apple does not shy away from inventing new materials and production methods. Sometimes these new production methods include automated fitting of components to others based on minor differences, like the glass backs of the iPhone 5 which were uniquely fitted to their casings based on image analysis of minor differences[^citation needed].
* When planning the doughnut-shaped new company building, Apple Park, a whole segment of the building was prototyped at 1:1 scale as a separate and fully-functional building to try out all the materials, test the construction, and see if it lived up to the high expectations. That “prototype” is still in use as one of the cafes near the older main Infinite Loop campus.
