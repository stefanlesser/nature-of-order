title: "3 Slowly created harmony in a massive project: the example of the Athens Megatron"

> Because of labor rates and time pressure, construction has to move in very large volumes and at a massive rate, otherwise it becomes too costly in time and money. During the 20th century, as a result of these conditions, work was typically crude, governed only by the capacity to go fast and cheap — and this led to the devastating loss of personal quality and of local order and adaptation which the four books of _The Nature of Order_ are all about.  
> The question is, under our modern conditions where labor rates *are* high, and where the need for speed *is* pressing: Can we hold cost constant and yet construct large works in a way which is profound, personal, detailed, and loving — yet still respectful of these necessary conditions that are nowadays imposed by the modern era?
