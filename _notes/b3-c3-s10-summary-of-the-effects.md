title: 10 Summary of the effects

> Positive spaces have the quality that they open into one another, one into the next. Imagine, then, one step in the unfolding process.   
> One of the places in the growing hull — one center — is to be made better, more living. To accomplish that, it first has to be **better shaped itself**.   
> At the same time some **larger center** that it belongs to is to be made stronger also — that will often be the next space, the next larger space from which this one buds off like a limb-bud.  
> At the same time, too, the small center we started with is also to be strengthened by the formation of some still **smaller center** . That means either a smaller symmetrical space — even an arch, gate, or doorway leading into it — or some detailed local symmetrical center which adds to the center that has already been formed: a fountain, a seat, perhaps something very elaborate in the middle, perhaps not ore than a stone placed beside an old tree trunk.  

> Repeating this process, moving from center to center within the hulls of space, we see that **with time, inevitably**, step by step, just that structure which I have been describing will appear.
