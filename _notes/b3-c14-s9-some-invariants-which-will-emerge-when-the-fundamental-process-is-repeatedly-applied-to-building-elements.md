title: 9 Some invariants which will emerge when the fundamental process is repeatedly applied to building elements
---

> In a regime governed by living process — hence by repeated application of the fundamental process — every major building element becomes strong as a center. […]  
> The shape of all these centers will be strong, each in itself, and each center, being a strong shape, is itself made of smaller centers which are strong; to the side, in the gap between this and the next element, there is a strong shaped center, too.  
> Generally, the elements will be large in dimension compared with the dimension of the space between adjacent elements. The space between columns only a little bigger than the thickness of the column; the space between windows often only a little bigger or a little smaller than the size of the windows; the space of a building wall between cornice and plinth only a little bigger than the plinths or the cornices themselves.  
> The most important elements will then exist as centers *so strongly* that they appear to be shaped, powerful, “being-like”.
