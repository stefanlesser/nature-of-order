title: Rules for identifying centers
---

General rules which identify zones of space that stand out as centers:

- Sets which appear as entities are often, but not always, **locally symmetrical**
- Entities are usually **bounded**: there is often a sharp change of structure at their edge
- Some entities are marked by an internal center where there is another **change of continuity** near the middle of the center itself
- There is a **simplicity and regularity** about these sets which marks them as wholes, and makes them function as entities
- They are often relatively **homogenous** across their **interior**, compared with the surrounding space
- There is a topological connectivity in them which marks them as **compact**
- They are usually — not always — **convex**
