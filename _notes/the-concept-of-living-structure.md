<- [[Why do the 15 properties occur in nature?]]

> The repeated appearance of the fifteen properties in natural systems is a profound result, **not merely a by-product of presently available mechanical explanations** about the world. Rather, it suggests a new view of all nature as living structure. It implies that […] the distinction between degrees of life in things, the role played by the fifteen properties in creating life in space — is not merely appropriate for artifacts, but must be extended to **include all naturally occurring structures**. In this scheme of things, nature itself then becomes visible as **something quite different from the mechanical nature that 19th- and 20th-century physicists used to imagine**.

> There is life — more of it and less of it — in inanimate nature, too.
> But all this — all of what we loosely and traditionally call “nature” — is then characterized by just that actual life which I have identified in the better human artifacts. Within the terms of my definitions, then, nature as a whole — all of it — is made of living structure. […] **Whether organic or inorganic, most of it is alive** in the terms that I have defined. **The living character of these structures is different from the character of other conceivable structures that could arise**, and it is this character which we may call *the* living character of nature.

> Among natural phenomena, the fifteen properties seem to appear, pervasively, in almost *everything*. Yet among human artifacts, the fifteen properties appear only in the *good* ones. **How can the very same properties be marks of *good* structure in human artifacts, and yet be present in *all* of nature? What is it about nature which always makes its structures “good”?**

> The essence of the problem is that we have not, as far as I know, ever yet concentrated our attention on the fact that **in nature, *all* the configurations that *do* occur belong to a relatively small subset of *all* the configurations that *could possibly* occur**. It is that which permits, I believe, the characterization of a certain class of structures as living structure.

> For some reason nature, when left to its own devices, generates configurations in L [configurations which have living structure], but […] human beings are able, for some reason, to jump outside L, into the larger part of C [all possible three dimensional arrangements that might exist]. That is, **human beings — and designers, above all — are able to be un-natural**.

> The sum total of all that could occur (C), is the set of all possible (imaginary and actual) configurations that might appear in the world. But **nature does not create all *possible* configurations**. In fact, what we call **nature only creates things from a drastically limited set of configurations** (L), which are **constrained by restrictions on the types of process that occur in nature**.
> Essentially, **nature always follows the rule that each wholeness which comes into being preserves the structure of the previous wholeness**, so that all of nature is just that structure which can be created by a smooth structure-preserving process of unfolding.
> 
> That is why we see the fifteen properties throughout almost all of nature, at almost all scales. And, even though this living structure in nature is a product of natural laws, **in buildings and human artifacts, which are works of imagination, these restrictions on structure-preserving processes do not necessarily apply**. It is possible — very *easily* possible — for human designers to design *unnatural* structures of a kind which could not (in principle) occur in nature.
> In nature the principle of unfolding wholeness […] creates living structure nearly all the time. **Human designers, who are not constrained by this unfolding, can violate the wholeness if they wish to**, and can therefore create non-living structure as often as they choose.
