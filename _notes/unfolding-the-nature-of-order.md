title: Unfolding the Nature of Order
---

In book 2 Alexander describes the [[unfolding process]].

It becomes apparent that he must have thought about this process of unfolding when he structured his books. There is a visually visible hierarchy in the [[structure of the books]], parts, chapters, and sections.

We tend to read books sequentially from beginning to end, unless we are revisiting the material, or if we only want to find relevant parts and avoid having to read the whole thing. But what if there was a way to explore _The Nature of Order_ in a non-linear fashion, keeping a sense for the whole at all times, quickly learning about the key concepts, and diving deeper into only that what interests us at this time?

I suggest that such a more interactive exploration is possible and this collection of notes you're reading right now will over time hopefully become one way of doing that.
