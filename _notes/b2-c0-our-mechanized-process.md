title: "Our mechanized process"
---

> The trouble is that it is *mechanical* process only, something which subverts the inner fire of true living process.  
> In a mechanistic view of the world, we see all things, even if only for convenience, as machines. A machine is intended to accomplish something. It is, in its essence, goal-oriented. Like machines, then, within a mechanistic view processes are always seen as aimed at certain ends. **We think of things by the end-state we want, and then ask ourselves how to get there.**  

> Real kindness is something quite different, something valuable in *itself*. It is a true process, not guided by the grasp for a goal, but guided by the minute-to-minute necessity of caring, dynamically, for the feelings and well-being of another. This is not trivial, but deep; sincerely related to human feeling; and not predictable in its end-result, because the end-result is not a goal.  
> Unlike the goal-oriented picture, which is imposed intellectually on our substance as persons, real kindness is a process true to our essential human instinct and to our knowledge of what it means to be a person. But the machine-age view showed a process like kindness as being oriented toward a *goal*, just as every machine too has its purpose — its goal, what it is intended to produce.  

> The process of getting to the goal was thought to be of little importance in itself, except insofar as it attained (or failed to attain) the desired goal.  

> The mechanistic view of architecture we have learned to accept in our era is crippled by this overly-simple, goal-oriented approach. In the mechanistic view of architecture we think mainly of *design* as the desired end-state of a building, and far too little of the *way* or *process* of making a building as something inherently beautiful in itself.   
> But, most important of all, the background underpinning of this goal-oriented view — a static world almost without process — just is not a truthful picture. As a conception of the world, it roundly fails to describe things as they are. It exerts a crippling effect on our view of architecture and planning because it fails to be true to ordinary, everyday fact. **For in fact, everything is constantly changing, growing, evolving.**  

> Why is this process-view essential? Because the ideals of “design”, the corporate boardroom drawing of the imaginary future, the developer’s slick watercolor perspective of the future end-state, control our conception of what must be done — yet they bear no relation to the actual nature, or problems, or possibilities, of a living environment. And they are socially backward, since they necessarily diminish people’s involvement in the continuous creation of their world.  
> In all this, *process* is still not present as something essential, only as something mechanical. In our profession of architecture there is no conception, yet, of process *itself* as a budding, as a flowering, as an unpredictable, unquenchable unfolding through which the future grows from the present in a way that is dominated by the goodness of the moment.  

> Our understanding of process, like our understanding of order, has been severely compromised by the value-neutral Cartesian picture, and in a similar fashion. In the case of static order at least, everyone knows that things have value; the mistake has been in the fact that we have been encouraged to think that the value of an object is subjective. Process presents a deeper problem since, in our time (with some exceptions), we are not used to evaluating it at all, even in subjective terms. We have yet to learn that , objectively, there is life-creating process and life-destroying process.
