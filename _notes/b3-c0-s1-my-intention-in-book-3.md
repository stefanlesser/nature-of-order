title: My intention in book 3
---

### Question to be answered
 * What happens if living processes are used pervasively, in widespread fashion, in our own era? What kind of overall environment may we expect to see from their effects?
 * Examples of large buildings, small buildings, neighborhoods, gardens, public space, wilderness, houses, construction details, color, ornament.
 * What is likely to happen *in the large*: to show the likely impact on the whole.

### The vision portrayed
 * is the start of a vision of the kind of world we are likely to get from living processes if we use them today and tomorrow.
 * This world is indeed living, because it is generated by repeated application of living processes. Such a world:
	 * is nourishing to human life and to human feeling
	 * encompasses what we need, our joys, our sorrows
	 * can be a model of the kind of world in which we 
		 * might wish to live and 
		 * can live well
 * A picture independent of our era
	 * valid and relevant in any future period of history
		 * equally appropriate to the 24th or 30th century
* The world will (must) look something like what is shown in book 3
	* if it is truly generated by adaptation, no matter
		* what the world is like
		* what its style is
		* its immediate technical character
	* if it truly is a living structure

### A broad general character
* structural invariants independent of
	* technology
	* materials
	* social habits
	* culture
* must be present in all worlds made appropriate to the inner life of human beings
* not an idiosyncratic personal vision
* not a style or particular way of design
