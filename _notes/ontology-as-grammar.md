I have hit upon something that lets one to unfold a sequence out of a seed like this visualization by @elzr: <https://twitter.com/elzr/status/1371732525106790402>

This is a great visualization! Thanks for sharing.

This is how I picture the design process. Each level in the tree is a design decision. With every decision you **differentiate/specialize** the solution more and make other solutions impossible; reduce the solution space.

Of course, when building, the solution space is not limited like in this example. The tree is not binary and every decision has probably infinite possible choices. The depth of branches varies. And it's not even a tree in the first place, but a (semi-)lattice, where some decisions let you cross over to another branch again (which is impossible in a tree).

In computing we often deal with solution spaces restricted like this, with certain **orders, regularities (symmetries!), limits, and/or discrete structures**.

This example, however, also adds some interesting ideas around **representations**. A simple sequence of four binary decisions yields 16 possibilities. But what these 16 possibilities stand for ‚Äî what they represent ‚Äî is completely **arbitrary**. Their **meaning is constructed**, based on metaphoric structuring that "makes sense" to us. All examples even map more or less directly to embodied schemas.

I love the part where he reveals the logic gates, as that is a more subtle and less expected meaning, and **not all** sixteen **paths map to a useful thing**. That is much more like design, where you also end up with lots of possibilities that are not useful.

I guess a deep question here is: are these meanings showcased in the video **inherent to the structure** itself (Do they exist in reality?), or are they **constructs of the mind**? üòé

[‚Ä¶] I didn‚Äôt quite think of **ontology as grammar** before! But of course, that is the function of ontology, to provide one kind of primitives for a grammar (rules being the other). And the grammar is the **generative framework for creating larger constructs out of these smaller primitives**. A grammar helps us **form meaning-/use-ful constructs** more easily by guiding our choices to more sensible ones that follow the grammar‚Äôs rules, but still allows us to generate infinitely many solutions.

And choosing an ontology, picking those labels, is **not arbitrary**! It theoretically can be, of course. But that wouldn‚Äôt make sense ‚Äî literally: **we only pick labels that make sense to us** in some way. This, I think, is how **metaphorical structuring** connects to this.

**‚ÄúGood‚Äù primitives**, a carefully picked **ontology which ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù**, is what *A Pattern Language* is on a fairly high level, what metaphoric structures and embodied schemas are in human language just beneath the language level, and what ifrit describes in the linked thread on a mathematical low level.

Exciting. I need to let this sink in more before I get to the second half of your post‚Ä¶

I think this is where "meaning" can change from what is **fundamentally mathematical (and/or cognitive) on the lowest-levels** to **image-laden and constructed on the higher-levels**. For instance that we now have mental models of how things work in the grammar of capitalism, and therefore certain actions make more sense in that grammar than others. Yet, the whole thing is just a construction which happens to be somewhat coherent enough for us to make sense of it and with it.

In that sense, Alexander is trying to focus our attention on the **lowest-level grammar** that is apparently **"built-in"**, either into our fundamental perception of the world or ‚Äî what he really wants it to be ‚Äî into the structure of the universe itself.
