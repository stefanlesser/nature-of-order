title: 8 Using the fundamental process to get the design of a concrete truss
---

> At an early stage in its evolution, I reached the idea of a long building, wrapped around the site, with two courtyards in ti like donut holes. It was the client’s liking for this idea that got us the job.  
> One notices, right away, that latent in this structure is the center formed by the volume between the two courtyards. You feel this latent center even in the roughest sketch. So now, this center between the courtyards begs for attention. It is a latent center of considerable power.  
> At the next stage in the evolution of the design, we allowed this center to develop, to strengthen. It became a dining hall. This did not emerge as an “idea” or a “concept”. It appeared, organically, in a step by step process, by applying the fundamental process to the building layout as a whole.
