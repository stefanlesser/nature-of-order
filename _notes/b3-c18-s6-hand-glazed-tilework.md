> Paint, which is our modern way of making color, has a very short life. The very use of paint already implies that color is not being taken seriously.  
> If we put the amount of effort into color, which is required — days and days of concentration — to get the light to shine just right, it is discouraging and impractical to accept that the paint might have to be repainted after a few years. It would in any case be difficult or impossible to get exactly the same colors again.  

> In tilework, the most beautiful patterns often come about because of repetition. Here we see [[alternating repetition]] come to life in the most wonderful way.
