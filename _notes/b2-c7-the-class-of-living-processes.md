title: "The class of living processes"

> Most living processes are of one of three types:  
> 1. A **single use** of the fundamental process.  
> 2. A **string of steps**, each one an instance of the fundamental process, the series strung together one after the other, so that the process may be seen as the sequential creation of living centers.  
> 3. A **nested hierarchy of steps**, each one an instance of the fundamental process, so that these steps are carried out not in a single precise order, but in a general broad order, each one then calling upon further steps, until the whole is finished.  

> A living process may occur **in a personâ€™s mind** while conceiving the idea of a great building. A living process may happen **in the cooperative work of a group of people** making a park or a building together; it may happen **in the actual fabrication or creation** of a building element; it can happen **in the peripheral processes** which govern aspects of buildings, plans, and the environment.  

> A living process always preserves a certain natural order, and happens in a certain natural sequence. Typically (though not always), we may say that the process moves **from larger wholes to smaller ones**, first allowing the largest ones to unfold from the context, then growing or filling in smaller ones within the context of the larger whole.  
> At other times, though, a process goes the other way, **beginning with a small thing, which then grows larger, and extends, preserving or developing a larger wholeness**. That is what happens when one particular plant grows in a forest. The forest does not first establish a larger plan for the forest as a whole. What happens is that each small process acts to contribute to a (not yet perfectly defined) emerging larger whole, and keeps developing the wholeness in that way.
