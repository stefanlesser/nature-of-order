title: 2 Belonging and true comfort

### Experiencing emotional possession of the places we are in
If you feel as if you belong in the place you live, work, and play, if it feels like it belongs to you, that you are part of it, then you experience the fine and subtle adaptation between people and environment.

This belonging is almost never individual or idiosyncratic, but collective.

We are no longer used to feeling belonging in the callous, mercenary, and indifferent environment which we experience around us most of the time.

> It has become rare that a relationship of true belonging exists between the family and the apartment or house they inhabit.  

> It is still difficult to implement the kind of innovations in construction — administrative, financial, and other processes — that allow fluid adaptational construction contracts and still keep a tight hold on time and money.
