title: "The breadth of processes that can be improved"
---

> I want to emphasize that almost any social process can have a relatively *more* living character, or have a relatively *less* living character.  

> Any one of these processes can, in principle, *help* to create living structure in the whole, or it may work *against* the formation of living structure in the whole. That means, broadly speaking, that **any process may help, or hinder, the formation of living centers**, and may help or hinder the emergence of life in the whole.  

> In principle, every social process which **plays *any role at all* in the formation of the environment** is potentially a living process.  

> All extant processes may be scrutinized, tested, examined for the degree to which they are life-creating or not. And it is reasonably clear that *all* types of processes, since they *all* have some impact on the formation of the environment, should be made more living in order for our towns and buildings and our outdoor landscape to come to life. In short, **not one of the processes in any of these categories should escape our scrutiny**.
