> The process of formation that occurs in nature — whether it happens in microseconds or over millions of years, whether it is large or small, whether it comes from the organic or the inorganic world — is in every case *smoothly structure-preserving*. Each of the sequences in the last pages shows a sequence where **successive stages are so alike as to be hardly distinguishable**. **Yet what is accomplished overall, from the beginning to the end of each sequence, is enormous.** New form comes into being. Morphogenesis occurs. New form that is, in almost every case, unpredictable from the initial state appears smoothly via a **sequence of tiny continuous changes**.  
> The sequences are not merely smooth. We have, in every case, a sequence in which new structure grows organically, holistically, from the structure which is there already. One whole gives rise to another.  
> It is this smooth and elegant “becoming” or unfolding of the whole which is the characteristic of nature. The continuity and smoothness of unfolding wholeness may seem obvious. Indeed, in a certain sense, it *is* obvious, Yet, as a creative process, it is sharply at odds with the human process of creation we have come to expect in contemporary art and architecture.
