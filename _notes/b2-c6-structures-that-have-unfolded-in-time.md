title: "Structures that have unfolded in time"
---

> In the generated structures A-C we have a **strong sense** that they **unfolded over time**. We have a **feeling**, an **intuitive certainty** that the plans could only have been **generated over time**.  
> On the other hand, in D-F it is very clear that the design was created **at one moment in time as an *arrangement***. [â€¦]  
> We know that A-C happened in time in some *meaningful* way, and in a way which mattered, and which gave them their deep essential structure. In D-F, the role of time is insignificant, trivial. Time did not affect the structure, or contribute to its design.  

*This seems to be less about the time, and more about the opportunity of feedback, which does need time to be responded to.*
