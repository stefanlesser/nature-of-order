title: 14 Conclusion — Geometric features which follow from the use of living process in the making of large buildings
---

> Perhaps the most vital thing about a large public building, and its form, is that it honors and respects the land, grows out of the land in a natural way.  

> A successful large building will always show the subtle syncopation of regularity of structure combined with subtle, and gentle accommodation to the land and its contours — in the monastery, visible in the plan and in the profile of the model as the building juts out from the hill, almost grows out of it.  
> And at the same time, the larger masses of the building will be offset by a continuous range of scales and levels, going all the way down to the most intimate details of construction, genuinely completing and strengthening the large structure of the whole.  

> These qualities, the combination of larger and small, often in a stunning range of scales, will always come about somehow, in combination with love for the land, when a large building emerges from a living process. Within that structure, the entities which exist go down to the tiniest details.
