> To imagine what this process might be like, one has to imagine a process of gardening — especially in an old and rather wild garden, where the pruning, gardening, weeding, are all selective, and where the wild plants and cultivated plants grow together, and emerge from the act of gardening itself. It is then the dynamics of the process in time, and the intelligent and motivated process of reacting to successes and failures, which creates the final whole… **not some static image, which can be drawn on a plan at the beginning**.  

> This is a new kind of process, not consistent with existing processes. And because of the way such a process works, it is not practical to create this life by first making a drawing, and then asking someone else to build it. **That division of activities is not consistent with the inner logic of the process.**
