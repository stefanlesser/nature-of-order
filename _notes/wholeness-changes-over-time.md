title: Wholeness changes over time

<- [[Wholeness]]

> Wholeness **changes continuously** through time, and is dependent on subtle — sometimes even minute — changes in the configurations in it and around it.

> All centers that appear in space — whether they originate in biology, in physical forces, in pure geometry, in color — *are* alike simply in that they all **animate space**. It is this animated space that has its functional effect upon the world, that determines the way things work, that governs the presence of harmony and life.

*Do affordances come from wholeness?*

> But it is no small thing to see the world like this: a **unitary source of organization**, all of it **anchored in space**, which space *itself* the stuff that comes alive. That is the enigma. But it is also that which forms the effective substrate of the view I am presenting here, which gives us the possibility of understanding life at all.
