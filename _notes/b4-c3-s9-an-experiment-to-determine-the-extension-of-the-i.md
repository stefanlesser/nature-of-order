title: An experiment to determine the extension of the I

> So here we had a very primitive experience, which indicates the I as being larger than our own bodies, experienced in this instance as being outside our bodies occupying the space between our bodies and the thing we were looking at — apparently because of the more I-like nature of the second cushion. It appeared that a substance like the red cushion, because more deeply connected to the I, will actually expand the experience of I in us, make our connection to a larger “something” more plainly visible.

> Apparently, we do experience the world like that.
