### Strength of our present scientific world picture
* Parts of the world are are to be viewed through mathematical models or mechanisms
	* mental models with precise rules of behavior
	* match reality in such a powerful degree that we can predict, and manipulate the behavior of the world, almost throughout the full range of its scales and substances

> All in all, we have succeeded in building successful models of the matter in the universe and its behavior, in a way that is wonderful and powerful. It is a collective achievement of an order incomparable with almost any previous human achievement. Our modern world in all its beauty — and fascinating and wonderful as it is to live in it — depends on this achievement.
