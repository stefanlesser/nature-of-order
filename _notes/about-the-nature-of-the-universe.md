title: About the nature of the universe
---

_The Nature of Order_ has a subtitle: _An Essay on the Art of Building and The Nature of the Universe_. Alexander proposes two features of his theory large enough to justify the claim of being about the nature of the universe:

- All space and matter, organic or inorganic, has **some degree of [[life]]** in it and matter/space is more alive or less alive according to its structure and arrangement.
- All matter/space has **some degree of “self”** in it, and this self, or some aspect of the personal, is something which infuses all matter/space and everything we know as matter but now think to be mechanical.

*I’m picturing a spectrum with the poles dead and alive, and all matter/space exists somewhere on that spectrum. Humans and animals furthest to the right, a brick probably furthest on the left, but things like fire somewhere in the middle.*
