title: "The death of beauty: a huge system effect which destroys all feeling"
---

> The present-day piecemeal and fragmented processes of our society, are *not* oriented towards creating wholes. They are highly organized, yes. But they are *not* oriented, in their substance, towards the creation of living wholes. They are oriented coherently, but towards making money, or creating power… other matters entirely.  

> Thus the 20th-century process interrupts the process of paying attention to wholeness, the unfolding of wholeness, and the process of shaping the surface of the Earth correctly.   
> At the same time it also robs people of the simple joy of acting appropriately, in a way that is fulfilling.  

> It may seem ridiculous to say that the world will be improved — in its organization — if people are able to act, at every scale, according to their feeling. *But it is the whole that is being damaged by the loss of feeling.*  
> By not allowing people to act according to the global feeling of the situation, that means that each of the prevailing processes — whether they have to do with development, or land purchase, or transportation planning, or banking, or speculation, or construction-contract administration — they all, in their present form, have the capacity to damage feeling and therefore to fly in the face of the interests of the global whole.  

> Worst of all, perhaps, is the fact that the processes which exist — which we now take for granted — in many cases virtually outlaw living process, make living process fundamentally and practically impossible, impossible even to *imagine*, since the ground rules of the processes we know today have driven them out so far.
