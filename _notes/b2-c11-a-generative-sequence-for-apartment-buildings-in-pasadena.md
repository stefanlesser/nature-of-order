title: "A generative sequence for apartment buildings in Pasadena"
---

> To get the sequence, a pattern language similar to the languages illustrated later (chapter 13), was first constructed for these multi-family apartment buildings, then re-formulated as a generative sequence. See chapter 13, throughout, for techniques necessary to obtain relevant and vital generic centers as the substrate for a pattern language.  
> In its sequence form it gives the user a process of unfolding in such a way as to allow a building with good plan, volumes, and organization to be made, very easily, to fit the particular conditions of any given site.  

*This reminds me of the Human Interface Guidelines, which are essentially patterns for good UX. Could there be a sequence-form of the HIG?*
