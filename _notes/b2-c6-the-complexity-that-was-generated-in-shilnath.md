title: "The complexity that was generated in Shilnath"

> The primary way in which complexity of structure reveals itself, is in the **internal density of significant relationships** which exist. When adaptation occurs successfully, and each line or element created is created in such a way as to avoid its possible mistakes, it does this by creating meaningful relationships in every direction.  

*This is where tight and loose coupling in software components come into play, somehow…*

> One small house thus enters into at least seven meaningful relationships, overlapping and connected.  Each of these relationships is **embodied as a center**, and these seven centers are strong and living ones.  
> Further, the relationships are **motivated by practical daily-life concerns**, which come from people’s most ordinary strivings and needs and wishes. They are not esoteric artistic efforts to create nice space, as a western artist might attempt: Rather they are very mundane, sensible, and practical expressions of real thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions, games, commerce, and neighborly behavior. They are above all down to earth.  

> The subtlety of these relationships, and the connective tissue which they form, is a large part of the life in any living structure. Each of these relationships takes the form of a living center.  
> Since the one example I have been discussing alone creates some seven vitally important living centers, as a result of the extreme carefulness of placing and position, size, and shape, we may surmise that the community as a whole probably contains some 7 x 150 or about a thousand overlapping living centers. This is the true complexity typical of any living structure, and as in this instance, such complexity can only be created when the structure is a generated one.
