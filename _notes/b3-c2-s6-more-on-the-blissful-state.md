title: 6 More on the blissful state
---

The blissful state has so much to do with being free.

> There are some physical circumstances that give rise to the feelings I am speaking about. They have nothing to do with user design and contracting procedures. The beach is an obvious example of a classic place where people feel that youthful freedom in themselves.  

*The connection to youthful makes me wonder if in today’s world, we are also much more obliged to follow a predetermined path in terms of family and career, and the expectations and social pressures that come with it make it harder for us as grow up to be and feel free.*

> But it is possible, I believe, for places we make for ourselves consciously to have this quality. I believe it is the characteristics of the actual space itself that create a luminous simplicity in which the human spirit can take hold and make it one’s own. That quality exists, I think, always as a result of true unfolding, as a result of any truly living process.  

> No 20th-century architect will proudly say: I did this. Yet, *this* is where that inner something starts to live and breathe.  

### Debris is part of living structure
The world does not work when it is too clean, too closely following a perfect image.
