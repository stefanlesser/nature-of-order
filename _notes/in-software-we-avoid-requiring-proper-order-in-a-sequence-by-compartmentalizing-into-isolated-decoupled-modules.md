title: In software we avoid requiring proper order in a sequence by compartmentalizing into isolated decoupled modules
---

Alexander focuses on finding the right order for a sequence of generative unfolding. This accepts the many relations that exist between centers and tries to find a path to build them up in the order that minimizes backtracking, but it doesn’t try to get rid of these relations.

In software we could a different “solution”: we try to reduce the number of relations between centers by trying to make them more independent from each other.

Is it this independence that causes our artifacts to feel less coherent and whole?

This also takes away the need for us to constantly look at the larger whole. We can get by with just focusing on the current component — probably another reason why we end up with something less coherent.
