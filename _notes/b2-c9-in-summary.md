> In a living process, what is always happening is that every step (large or small, whether it comes late or early) is done in such a way as to increase the beauty — the life — of *the whole*. The process starts with a vision of a possible whole that comes out of the circumstances, that is felt as something which grows out of the form of the world. Every step is made with the idea that the feeling of this very large whole is being **made deeper, more intense**.  
> Even if it is only a tiny step, this is still the guiding rule.
