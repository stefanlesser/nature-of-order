title: "Forty thousand morphogenetic processes"
---

> There are — a rough guess only — perhaps two thousand *long* sequences which may be needed to make the environment well. And let us say that each of these long sequences, when cut apart, contains some twenty smaller sequences. That suggests that the total number of short sequences or process genes which could completely transform the built environment may be no more than about forty thousand.
