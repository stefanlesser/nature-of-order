title: 8 Mass-housing with unique apartments
---

> I have found that people who are used to today’s standardized apartments are sometimes skeptical about the importance of this kind of thing [individually designed plans]. Is it really helpful or necessary? Is it worthwhile?  

> What an extreme comment on the state of the world: that people should weep, merely because they are allowed to sketch  on paper the apartment layout that they wanted for their family. Their tears came long before any implementation. They wept, not because this was the practical realization of a dream… but merely because someone was talking to them and their family seriously enough, to allow this possibility to exist, even in their minds, and on a tiny square of paper.  
> Even I, with my assumptions about the importance of this kind of thing, was astonished that the process had such a direct impact. There were tears in other people’s eyes, too. Nearly all were overcome with emotion, just at being able to draw what they thought might be the ideal apartment for their family.
