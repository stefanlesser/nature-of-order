title: Search for real beauty
---

In _The Nature of Order_, Alexander writes about more than building and architecture — he writes about philosophy, and metaphysics. He grounds his theories in empirical facts, as he himself sometimes finds his results surprising and hard to believe, because they are at odds with “normal common-sense”.

### The practical reason Alexander investigates _The Nature of Order_
> The reason was not intellectual curiosity — but only the practical reason that *I wanted to be able to do it myself*.

### Beauty as an attainable ideal
Alexander criticizes that many of today’s architects have given up making real beauty and even given it up as an attainable ideal.

*This strikes me as similar to the programmers who designed early computer systems in the 1960-80s, when programmer and user were the same person. We have now split into experts and non-experts, and non-experts no longer have the power to create what experts can create.*
