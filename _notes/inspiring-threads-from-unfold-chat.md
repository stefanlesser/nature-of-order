* You can view [[Ontology as grammar]], and come to fascinating conclusions about how we structure and navigate solution spaces.
* What if we view [[Symmetry and recursion as repetition]]? Symmetry as repetition in space, recursion as repetition in time.
* Grammars stack recursively, getting gradually more abstract. More thoughts about [[Recursion and towers of abstraction]].
* There's a [[Dichotomy between process and structure]], imperative and declarative, logic as calculus and logic as language, and perhaps time and space â€” how do they all connect?
* _@Prabros_ makes a connection to the mathematical concepts of [[Functional completeness and ergodicity]].
* [[Eleatic philosophers]] gave priority to the world of forms over everyday experience.
