> I remain continuously *and exclusively* occupied with the problem of creating living structure. There is no additional agenda, no psychic, religious, or spiritual agenda. There is only the desire to create living structure and to create it well. But this means, as we shall find out, *creating* relatedness. And it is my desire that we may actually *succeed* in this, do it successfully — and, therefore, do everything that must be done to achieve it.

> From the study of history, I have become convinced that we cannot successfully create living structure in full degree without paying attention to the ground of all things — whatever that may be. We cannot do it, therefore, without allowing the formation of centers to be guided by the principle that (as far as possible) all living centers do make a connection with the ground.
