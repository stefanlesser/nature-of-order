### Feeling arises as an observation about the existing wholeness
> The use of feeling, in these steps, is not romantic, or arbitrary, or willful. Rather, in each case, the feeling arises *as an observation about the existing wholeness*, and moves to an observation about some direction of formation which is indicated by the wholeness: *it is where the wholeness itself leads the situation*.  

> The move which intensifies the feeling most, is the one which intensifies the configuration as it exists.
