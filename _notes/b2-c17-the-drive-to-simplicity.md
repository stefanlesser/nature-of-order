Simplicity and purity
	- making the essential in life come forward
	- allowing the inessential to be laid aside

> Our modern conception of simplicity has gone wrong. Simplicity as *depth* has been replaced by a mechanical idea of simplicity as the geometrically banal. And most recently, in reaction to the banal simplicity of cubes and spheres, postmodernism has reintroduced complexity and ornament in a way that is too often merely dross, icing, fruitcake, and trinkets, overlaid on the fabric, shape and substance of our buildings.  

> In this chapter, I shall try to introduce a new definition that is consistent with the nature of living structure. We shall arrive at a conception of simplicity which shows it as **the most pure thing which can arise**, truthfully, from a set of given circumstances, in a way that preserves structure, and as *the defining quality of a living process*.
