That cliff hanger question is a pretty interesting one. I have been mulling over that aspect a bit and what I have come to notice is that there’s this idea of **ergodicity / functional completeness** that comes into play here which leads to a contextual fit.

As you rightly outlined, you can do any kind of **arbitrary labelling** to the entities of the tree structure here. But, if it is to play nicely with the (a)symmetries of the space, there’s a way to label them so that you can **traverse the entire space of possibilities with a parsimonious set of primitives**. And that is what is meant by making it ergodic as seen in these tweets: <https://twitter.com/metadiogenes/status/1280682762996011008>

So if you follow that labelling Eli has done there and use just nand or nor gate from that labelling, you would be able to **generate all the rest of the combinations**. For completeness in computation, we usually take up the set of { and, or, not } + recursion. This can be seen nicely explained by Wolfram here: <https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/>

So about the structure itself, I think there’s something about functional completeness that makes some labelling more **accessible/traversible/reachable** in some sense than others which **limit our explorability** of the system.

So I guess this in some ways ties up with your idea of creating a system which you can **differentiate to solve the problem**. So if there’s a fit as in the Alexandrian sense, I think that is when the solutions to the set of problems you are trying to optimize for are **algebraically captured by the unfolding of the initial system**. Let me know if that writing made sense.

> And choosing an ontology, picking those labels, is not arbitrary! It theoretically can be, of course. But that wouldn’t make sense — literally: we only pick labels that make sense to us in some way. This, I think, is how metaphorical structuring connects to this.

Yes and I think there are sensible or rather **“complete” ways to partition the space of possibilities** so that we can “commute” with ease through the whole space with a **carefully constructed map** of the space. This is in some sense what **axiomatization in mathematics** is, when it succeeds to capture the underlying space of possibilities.

Great to see you draw parallel with Alexander’s Pattern Language here. My exposure is via NoFS, so I would probably need to read his literature further to grok the different aspects where it can be seen as this sort of map of possibilities. Also, looking forward to the second half’s reply.

[…] It might very well be that Alexander's 15 properties are inevitable "residue" in ergodic systems — I'm not sure that's the correct way to characterize it, I'm just learning about ergodicity myself, but it seems intuitively similar. […]

> I'm still mulling over the "functional completeness" part of it. The way I see it, a grammar does play a role in filtering out some forms that become the equivalent of syntax errors, so they reduce the solution space somewhat, but that is probably not in violence of what you mean by "functional completeness"?

* what I mean by the term: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness>
* the set { or, and, not }, { nand }, { nor }, { imply, not } etc. are **minimally functionally complete**: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness#Minimal_functionally_complete_operator_sets>
* **those set of operators are the only ones needed for you to construct any logical propositions representable in boolean algebra**. 
* Of particular interest might be the characterization given by Emil Post and his construction of the so called **“Post Lattice”** there: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%27s_lattice>
* The idea of completeness is explained in a somewhat accessible manner in **Wolfram’s post on building minimal axiom systems** I shared above. The parallel I have drawn between ergodicity and functional completeness is that both of them **reflect the capability to explore the full extend of the language that respect the grammar**.
* So thinking in a Chomskian sense, we have a machine that accepts/generates a language generated by a grammar. **Designing the grammar well** for a certain context **would allow the machine to generate the whole range of possibilities**.
* For instance, for a regular language, this would be the **Kleene algebra** with its set of primitives that allows one to express any regular language out there. So when creating a formal system, if one has the context thoroughly in mind and then design the logical steps necessary to cover it, you get “completeness” in my mind and it is ergodic in the sense: <https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/11/22/ergodic/>
* To be sure, there are **distinct advantages to making a system non-ergodic**, though I lack the (physics + logic)-fu to see how just yet.
