title: 4 Making a colored, ornamented, floor
---

> How does ornament unfold from the situation where it occurs?  

> In the end, it was obvious that if we did use these three colors, in these proportions, then the floor would have a freshness, and a beauty, which would delight our eyes every single day — not just be nice or well designed,  but a constant source of inspiration, something to draw life from every single time you looked at it.  

> My experience showed that once one had discovered something like this combination, it hinged on absolutely correct proportion; even minor changes would destroy the feeling.  

> Conventional checkerboard patterns don’t have three colors in these proportions. Indeed there was no ready-made pattern that we could use. Instead, we had to invent one. More exactly, it could be said that we had to let the color proportions *generate* a suitable pattern.  
> This again may be understood as a structure-preserving transformation. We had a bit of global information; the proportions needed to be 57:40:3. Now we had to find a way of obtaining, from that structure, the structure of a repeating diagonal pattern which could extend and enhance that global statistic among the colors.  

> In this example, the color and geometry are inseparable. The rough geometry first inspired the color. Then, exact study of the color showed us a set of crucial proportions which had to be maintained for inner light, and these proportions directly generated the pattern.
