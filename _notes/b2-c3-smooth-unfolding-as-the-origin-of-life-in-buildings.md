title: "Smooth unfolding as the origin of life in buildings"
---

> The modern world we build, because its construction is driven by our attitudes about money, production, design, building, and planning, breaks from smooth unfolding at almost every stage.  

> It is, ultimately, the process, not the design, which gives life to a building.  

*”Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” Plan = design, planning = process.*
