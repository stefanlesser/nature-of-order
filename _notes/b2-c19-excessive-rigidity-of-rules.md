title: "Excessive rigidity of rules"
---

> Rules are wrongly formulated. Processes are too rigid to allow adaptation. They cannot allow life to occur.  

> The process — viewed as a whole — *did not contain the capacity to create a living structure*. It contained the capacity, only, to create a poor approximation to living structure, by following a rule-bound scheme that could not even see the wholeness, much less appreciate it or protect it.  
> If a process were to be defined, which might replace the too-rigid setback rule, it would have to be one that both protects the larger whole, and is sensitive to the variations and needs of smaller local wholes.  

*When an answer is “it depends”, is that a sign that we are looking at the bigger picture (aka wholeness), instead of just following protocol?*
