### 15 structure-preserving transformations
	* Create: generate coherence in the large
	* Conserve: pull the future from the present
	* guarantee appearance of orderly, larger wholes with beautiful internal geometry
	* propagate beauty with enormous force, both locally and in the large

> The fifteen structure-preserving transformations have the capacity to **conserve and to create**. They create, generate coherence in the large â€” and it is *new* coherence that they generate. Yet they are conservative and **pull the future from the present**.  
> Further, these fifteen transformations, though simple, **guarantee the appearance of orderly, large and larger wholes with beautiful internal geometry**. Instead of making aggregates of random structures, they **propagate beauty with enormous force**, both locally, and in the large.
