title: Making wholeness heals the maker

> People are deeply nourished by the process of creating wholeness.

> If a person dedicates himself to making the field of centers, to making things whole, the more he or she does it, the more whole he or she becomes within him- or herself. Even one act of making this field of centers, a few minutes, or an afternoon, done honestly and in full pursuit of the real thing, changes a person and brings a level of calmness, quietness, and peacefulness which is quite unusual into that person.

On the other hand, so long as I am making stuff that does not have life in it, I feel dull, listless, oppressed. And even then, when I am feeling dull and listless like that, because of not making anything alive, the tiniest success, even in a tiny thing — it may be a painting, a detail of a building, a building plan, even just locating a building correctly in relation to a certain tree — all at once I wake up, I feel joyful and happy. The happiness lasts, sometimes for several days. It seems that the smallest success in making life extends and fills my experience for hours or days. The absence of it starves me.
