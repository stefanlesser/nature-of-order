title: 4 The surprising nature of the color that unfolds

> We tried Andreâ€™s milky blue first. It looked strange, almost white, because the room itself is so bright. Andre, as much as I, recognized that it was hopeless in that place. Then we started trying all kinds of things on bits of cardboard that we painted and pinned up as we went along. When we finally found the color that put the room in harmony, and made some kind of comfortable, natural feeling there, that arose from the room itself, it was entirely unexpected, a darkish read, almost one might call it an over-saturated darkening red with qualities of pink. When we found it, together, we agreed that that color was the one.
