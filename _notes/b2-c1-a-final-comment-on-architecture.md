> Yet if the observations of this chapter are held to be true about the production of living structure, and if, as I have suggested, living structure *always* arises slowly, by successive transformations of what exists, gradually, gradually, and then decisively changes slowly until a new thing is born, then the view of the unfettered architect-creator that has been fostered in the last four hundred years, must be completely wrong.
