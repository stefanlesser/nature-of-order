title: 10 The vital need for a collective vision

> Do it with the people, pulling the statements from their own lips. Make sure you ask each person, always, what is the deepest feeling you have about life, and what does *that* dictate. Go one pattern at a time, and when debate is needed, debate it, argue it out, one pattern at a time. Have someone — an architect, anyone trained like the staff members of the Center for Environmental Structure, who is not concerned to impose an egocentric image on the community — coordinating the work of putting this language together so that it can be made coherent and useful — and, if possible, poetic.  
> Do all this with a careful awareness of deep morphology so that […] the system of patterns and sequences becomes *generative*, capable of conjuring up a whole geometric world when it is let loose.
