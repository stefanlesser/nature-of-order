title: 2 Every building is placed and shaped to form a positive pattern of space
---

> Each act of building — every single act of building — has a positive effect on its surroundings. It completes the surroundings, preserves their structure, makes them deeper, makes them better, by creating strong centers in them and next to them.  

> Instead of harming its surroundings, as so many buildings do today, instead of standing alone in precious isolation, each new building fits into its context, makes the larger area more profound, enlarges it in spirit.
