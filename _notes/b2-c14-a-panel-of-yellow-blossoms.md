title: "A panel of yellow blossoms"
---

> In frustration at the build-up of thick paint, I wiped the whole panel clean with turpentine. But I had discovered the essential thing about the physical device needed to realize the deep feeling of heavenly blue that remained in my mind’s eye. To make the blue shine, in the way that created the feeling I had experienced, the painting needed big yellow blossoms towards the top.  

> From the beginning to the end, even when the panel reached its final “yellow” state, I held the vision of the inner shining blue, that had first prompted me to make the panel in that place.
