title: 4 The most basic feature of living structure
---

> It is the way that nature works. It is guided by the fundamental process. That means it is guided by a process which creates centers in continuous feedback from the system, and according to the centers which are already appearing there. Since the whole changes constantly, continuous feedback is needed while something is made in order to give it life. That is the essence of all “making” — it is a creation in which the maker responds with feedback, continuously, to the whole that is emerging.  

> We were used to a system of production in which parts were not shaped according to their context, were not shaped according to the whole where they appear. But still — this is the meaning of unfolding and the meaning of the fundamental process. If we are to have true living structure, it cannot be avoided.
