> One would imagine that at least the *goal* of bringing life to larger wholes would be understood and respected.  

> I tell this story partly because it is important, I think, for readers of this book to understand well in advance, to be prepared, perhaps, for a lack of sympathy even on such a deep and obvious matter concerning the living structure of the world. It does not mean that structure-preserving processes are impossible to achieve. It just means that in many circles, it may be necessary to prepare the ground rather carefully, so that people understand the point of what one is trying to do.  

> Unfortunately there is some negative voice like this sitting inside most of us, sometimes even inside our own heads, discouraging us from really and truly making every process structure-preserving to the larger whole. This is a kind of mental inhibition (sometimes fueled by ego, sometimes by greed) which continually makes us focus on the local, *and forget, or ignore, the extent to which we must make something living or beautiful happen in the large* â€” or forget that it is our responsibility, at every turn, to heal and make more whole, the structure of the world.
