title: Conclusion

> A living region […] can be created successfully only if many, many, many of the people in that society cooperate to make it happen — many individuals, **acting in their own way, yet acting together**.
> For this to happen in different places of the Earth, for it to happen in the place where you live, it virtually requires that you, too, whoever you are, must play some role in it. So I want to suggest that you, no matter who you are, no matter what your work in daily life may be, if you have the inclination, **choose to make yourself part of this process**.
