title: "The wondrous character of life in modern times"
---

> It is a love of life surviving in the smoke and ugliness and music of our time, drawing on the mass clothes and radios and computers; drawing on the informal shirtsleeve era that has entered our hearts with the American experiment throughout the modern world; drawing on the raucous and soft nature-loving urban motion of our era.  
> There is a passionate and wondrous feeling to be found in the activities of our age, sometimes in places hidden away, and found, surprisingly, all over the world today, as, in the midst of poverty and pain, people find a new freedom and a new opportunity to be themselves, and to take their own adventures.  

> The life which seems best, in our world, is that life which comes from efforts that are uncensored, natural and straightforward, from impulses close to our emotions and to our unsupported and peculiarly vulnerable human heart.
