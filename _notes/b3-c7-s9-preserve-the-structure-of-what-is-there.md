title: 9 Preserve the structure of what is there
---

> The newly created centers — the new positive spaces — work best, if they are based on some thing, some trace, that is there already. This is the key of the fundamental process anyway, that it embellishes the centers which are *there*. So we look for the most significant deep centers in the land, in the trees, in the flowers, in the views, and try to keep them intact, enlarged, intensified.  
> Leave them, and build hard structures which support them. What we build, may be formal, a structure of symmetries, that will support the natural land. […] You keep what you can.
