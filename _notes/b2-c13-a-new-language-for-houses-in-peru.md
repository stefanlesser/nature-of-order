> I found that if I looked at life from the point of view of being one of them, my *own* feelings, and my *own* knowledge of what had to be, was more reliable than anything else as an indicator of what was needed for a Peruvian family.  

*Empathy.*

> I barely needed to ask any questions about this: *I could feel it*, all of it, but I could feel it only by being one of them. I, myself (as Chris Alexander) didn’t have a house like that, and I don’t want a house like that — because for me, in Berkeley, with my family, it would not have made sense — it would not have been part of things, or part of the way my life works. But as a member of that Peruvian family, in the Peruvian culture, in the context of that family which I was a part of, it *did* make sense. It was natural, necessary, and I could feel its necessity, as part of *me*.  

> The essential technique in the observation of centers, in any social situation, and in any culture, is to allow the feelings to generate themselves, inside *you*. You have to say, “What would I do if I were one of the people living here, what would it be like for me?” thus inserting yourself into the situation, and then using your own common sense and feelings as a measuring instrument.  

> Of course you must always check with people, explicitly. You cannot assume you are right. You have to check. On the other hand, checking doesn’t mean just do what people say; their own sense of what is involved can also be in error. One must always go to the root, asking what is likely to create the most life, and maintaining a cautious skepticism, even while pursuing these difficult and soul-searching questions.  

> The culture-borne centers play a genetic role, not unlike the role played by genes in an organism. They describe what *is* — in a deep, inner sense. And they also describe how the world can be generated, to become congruent with people’s inner feelings, aspirations, habits, and society.
