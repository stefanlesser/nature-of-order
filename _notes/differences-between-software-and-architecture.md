title: Where software and architecture are different
---

*Here I collect weird and rough ideas about challenges I see about adopting Alexander’s theory from architecture to software.*

### Arranging atoms vs. arranging bits
Structure in software is different from structure in architecture.

In the physical space there are levels of scale and in the built environment especially there are relevant dimensions along those scales: from large objects like buildings to small objects to what we can still see with our eyes. Arranging matter on those scales takes more or less effort and material.

In software, these scales do not really exist, or are not as clearly visible, and do not have a similar relationship to resources.

### Static buildings vs. dynamic software
The product of architecture is mostly static structure — a building. The product of software is an application that responds differently to different inputs (although it also has a lot of static invariants).
