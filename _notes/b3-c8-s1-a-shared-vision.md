title: 1 A shared vision

> The community is ours because we share it; and to share it, we must have an agreed-on understanding of life there, what life means, how life is embodied in that place.  
> This means that to have true belonging in a place, people must **share a vision** of the place where they belong. […] It is not only agreement about practical matters, but agreement about the deeper meaning of the place.  

> Since people have different values, they have different visions of the world. […] A **shared pattern language** which defines our generic centers, one by one, gives us the tool we need to reach agreement, at a profound level, about what really matters in our world. And because this tool lets us build the picture, one pattern at a time, we can discuss things slowly enough among ourselves, to get agreement.  

> The idea is that the language of patterns **captures the essential “soul”** of the people and of the place, and **gets the essentials fixed in people’s minds** strongly enough so that it can become a basis for their dreams, and a practical basis for acts of planning and construction by any number of participants, as the neighborhood gets shaped and built.
