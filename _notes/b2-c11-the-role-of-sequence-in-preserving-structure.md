title: "The role of sequence in preserving structure"

> A generative sequence not only guarantees feasibility and the emergence of coherent form. It also provides the conditions in which structure-preserving transformations can occur successfully.  

> I can make the structure-preserving process work, only if things come *at the right time, in the right order*.  

> But suppose that, willfully, I place the tea house itself too early, because I think I know just the right spot for it! Then I have (**without explicitly intending it**) made commitments about the location of the inner garden, which may not be consistent with the larger issues. It may, for instance, now be difficult to get a nice path from the gate, through the outer garden, to the inner garden, and have the inner garden in a quiet place. I can probably still twist things around to make it work *somehow*. But I no longer have the ability in a relaxed, smooth, and simple way to do just what I have to do, what should be done, what is natural and necessary to do. In this case, **my willfulness has disturbed the possibility of laying this garden out in a way that preserves the structure of the whole**. As a result the chances of getting a living structure have been reduced. And all because I did things in the wrong order.
