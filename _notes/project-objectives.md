title: Project Objectives
---

There are several reasons why I put much effort into these notes and several outcomes I hope for:

* The main reason I’m working my way through these four massive books now is because I do that as part of my studies in [Building Beauty](https://www.buildingbeauty.org) the and the [Beautiful Software Initiative](https://www.buildingbeauty.org/beautiful-software). Good to have a place to keep my notes, make them publicly available, and **increase the number of interesting conversations** about this.
* There are many important ideas in Alexander’s work that need to be available to more **designers**, **builders**, and **makers** without them first having to commit to reading a 2000-page magnum opus, which appears to be from an unrelated domain, if you’re not an architect. Perhaps this site can help a little with making Alexander’s ideas more accessible outside of architecture and get more people interested in his work.
* Alexander’s work is timely. Even though it was published twenty years ago, his theory addresses the biggest **social, political, and ecological challenges** we face today and he presents a potential solution to change the world for the better. There is no better time than today to make his ideas more well known, as we struggle with finding solutions.
* A [tiny part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) of Alexander’s work has been adapted to the world of software. There are many more, and much more important insights that deserve the same treatment and need to be **translated into the tech industry**; it desperately needs it. I’m interested in figuring out [how we can achieve that](https://stefan-lesser.com/2020/10/27/how-to-adopt-christopher-alexanders-ideas-in-the-software-industry/).
* I’m testing and experimenting with the current iteration of my **personal knowledge management workflow**. This is a great project to collect more experience with many details involved in understanding source material deeply, integrating it into my existing knowledge network, and transforming it into valuable sharable bits of content. For instance, this is the first time I’m experimenting with a [[Digital Garden]], which [[Digital gardening is a living process|is like a living process itself]].
