title: 7 How can it really be that color and design come from unfolding?

> Normally we ascribe this refinement of design and color to the artist. How then, can I really claim that this comes from “unfolding”, that is to say from autonomous acts within the object and not from the will of the creator.  

> I explained there, how this too, though it has the quality of a vision and therefore is artistic (if one wants to use that word), really comes from a vision that arises in the mind’s eye as a result of painstaking, energetic, and unrelenting pursuit of the right feeling in the thing, the feeling which is there, then following and enlarging the thing, and the design coming solely from that activity.
