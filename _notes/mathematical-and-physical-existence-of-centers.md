title: Mathematical and physical existence of centers
---

Centers are not just a matter of cognition; they are mathematically and physically real.

> The entities which come into existence in a configuration are not merely cognitive. They have a **real mathematical existence**, and are actually occurring features *of the space itself*. They may be established mathematically according to the relative hierarchies of differentiation in the space. They are mathematically and physically *real*.
> And they have different degrees of strength.

The same question that is brought up in the paper [[The Architecture of Complexity]] is valid here: do these regularities appear important to us because they are **foundational principles of how the universe is structured**, or do they appear important to us because we are **hardwired biologically and/or psychologically to recognize** these patterns?
