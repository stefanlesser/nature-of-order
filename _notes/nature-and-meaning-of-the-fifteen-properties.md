title: The nature and meaning of the fifteen properties

<- [[Fifteen fundamental properties]]

Family resemblance:

> Roughly (and I must emphasize that this is only true to a first approximation), the fifteen properties define the enormous family of systems, among all possible systems, which have life in them.
> The fact that it is possible to characterize this family at all is surprising. The family which is so defined is very **complex morphologically**. Superficially, the many examples in this chapter look dissimilar. **Each belongs to its own time and place. They vary in culture, climate, and technology.** But more deeply, there is a sense in which these different cases all look the same. They all have **the same deep quality**; one sees **the same structure**, again and again, throughout the examples.
> Thus we have a grip, perhaps for the first time, on the **actual physical and geometrical character** which living systems have. It is not too much to say that any building which has life in it, *must* be a recognizable member of this family.

We consciously move away from buildings that exhibit these patterns — for no good reason:

> It should be observed that this fact is not neutral with regard to theories of architecture. One cannot help noticing that the buildings of recent decades (1940-90) are noticeably missing in these properties. I believe that this is intentional, and that **various unusual 20th-century theories of architecture have led architects and designers consciously to move away from these properties** in the effort **to promulgate some particular style or intention**. For people who have been brainwashed by these recent theories of design, it may be uncomfortable to confront the factual nature of the fifteen properties. I believe this cannot be helped.
> […]
> The sad truth is that the works of the last fifty years have **consciously abandoned understanding, or use**, of these properties. […] This does not mean that the fifteen properties have anything to do with ancient things as opposed to modern ones. […] The fact that there are relatively fewer examples to be shown from the last seventy years is **not polemical, but merely factual and proportioned**.

*In user interface design, we can find similar fashions driven by the intention to push a certain image and a tendency to avoid guidelines that describe well-working and proven interaction patterns just to do something new or different.*
