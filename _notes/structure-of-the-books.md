title: Structure of the books
---

It is worth looking at the structure of _The Nature of Order_. As Alexander is concerned with structure and geometry, he presumably put a lot of effort into the arrangement of the content across parts and chapters. The books are structured in several layers:

1. Books (4 volumes across about 2000 pages total)
2. Parts (each book has between 2-6 parts, plus prefaces, conclusions, and appendices)
3. Chapters (each part has between 2-12 chapters)
4. Sections (on average, each chapter has ~10 sections; sections have their own titles)
5. Text (on average, sections are thus short and only span a few pages)

It might seem strange to look at the books’ structure like this, but a lot can be learned from reading the chapter and section titles alone. It does help with [[unfolding The Nature of Order]] itself.

### Is this by design?

In one of his earlier books, _The Timeless Way of Building_, Alexander explicitly states in the preface that he structured that book with a quicker reading method in mind where you can read only sections printed in italics, which make about a third of that book, to get a broad understanding of the content, and then come back for more detail later.

While I couldn’t find any specific statement about _The Nature of Order_, it seems apparent to me that he at least wanted to make the books navigable by providing additional structure.
