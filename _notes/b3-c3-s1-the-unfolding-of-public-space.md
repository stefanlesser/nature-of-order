title: 1 The unfolding of public space

### Belonging is our business now
> That is our business now. From the largest to the smallest detail, we must ask ourselves: What is it about this technical matter, that must be done so as to support our belonging, our humanness, our capacity for love.  

### Start with the public space
> When living processes are applied systematically to the **public space** in a **human community**, they will — because of their emphasis on the formation of strong centers — generate a system of **articulated, useful, coherent, and mainly pedestrian** spaces.  

### Hulls of public space
	- coherent, partly enclosed public spaces that are positively shaped
	- holding and forming a kernel of outdoor space formed to be contained (almost as rooms or other interior spaces)
	- give communal structure to a town or a neighborhood

> Public space must always be positive in its geometric character.
