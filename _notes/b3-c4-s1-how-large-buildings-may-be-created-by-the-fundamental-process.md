title: 1 How large buildings may be created by the fundamental process
---

Large public buildings for the main centers that fix the public space and give it life.

An important space, a hull of public space, existing in rudimentary form, is to be embellished, made stronger, given more life. Usually one building becomes the “head”of the space. Other secondary buildings may also come into play as secondary centers.

> Almost without exception, this building is to be a **jewel**, it is to play a role of a vital center made to animate the public space. The volume of the new building, then, is created by its relation to the public space, by the need to make the space more alive by the insertion, and then differentiation, of this “jewel”.
