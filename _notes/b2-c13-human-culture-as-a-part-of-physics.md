title: "Human culture as a part of physics"

> The process of defining a good pattern language, is not only related to culture but to wholeness, and culture in relation to wholeness, is not merely social but a part of physics. […]  
> Living structure comes about only from the evolution of wholeness through structure-preserving transformations. For consistency, then, the definition of patterns, itself, as an activity, is also either structure-preserving or not, since this will be the basis of our ability to make *good* patterns — all this in the hope that we can then strive to make sure that our efforts to define new and better pattern languages are, indeed, structure-preserving.  
> Culture itself, and the wholeness which culture induces in the world, is as physical as the rest of wholeness. Only if we have a glimpse, at least, of that idea, will we be able, with all our energy, to focus on the problem of defining patterns which are indeed structure-preserving to present-day culture, yet searching, pointing towards, some new culture — and that the culture-wholeness system, too, can be considered as more alive, or less, so that the patterns we define contribute to the creation of a living world.  

> Above all, the place is now different because its wholeness is now different. It does not merely *seem* different, or have a different human picture of it. It *is* different. Mathematically, it is a different thing.  
> If, then, we seek to allow the world to unfold, thus creating life, it is this, the subtle, modified wholeness, affected as it is by culture, which must then unfold truthfully, to produce a living thing. The wholeness is, in large part, defined by the culture of that moment.   
> *The proper unfolding of wholeness is both an unfolding of space from the culture which exists, and an unfolding of a new (future) culture from the culture of the present.*   
> And all this is to be defined by the pattern language which reflects the inner needs and inner character, of the human and physical situation.
