title: 4 Dependence of the blissful state of our existence on the most ordinary quality in our surroundings
---

> Our *existence* — in its openness, clearness, and limpidity — depends to an immense degree on minute traces in the physical environment. It depends — more than is generally recognized — on the structure of the environment.  
> It is a deep harmonious feeling of belonging, something which makes us know that we are part of the Earth, that we are at home — wherever we are — truly at home, and that we are ourselves.  

> The world supports or does not support — supports in greater or lesser degree — this feeling of belonging. And it is only when it does support it that we may reasonably call it “life” in the environment.  

> Places have the capacity to deny us permission to be ourselves.  

> Only the adaptation of all kinds of subtle minutiae in the environment allows that wonderful thing — bliss, as I call it here — to emerge in us. And although this adaptation is very subtle, it has a huge effect.
