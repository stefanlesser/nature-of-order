title: "Improving computer-aided design (CAD) processes"

> The CAD drawing tool allows one to draw a bad project as easily as a good one. One may therefore say that the process is entirely neutral. But, of course, my whole point throughout Book 2 is this: *There is no such thing as neutrality in such matters.* A process is either life-creating, or it is not.  
> To be life-creating, even in some degree, it must have the effect that it encourages the formation of living structure — increases the freedom of the user to find his way to what is useful and appropriate — hence to find living centers, which preserve and extend the structure of the world.  

*Interesting that Alexander here comments on the neutrality of a software tool — a hammer or a saw used for building are tools that are equally as neutral and can be used for both good and bad projects. Why does CAD software have more responsibility here?*

> It is perfectly possible (in principle) that computer-based processes could be life-creating — because such processes could, of course, be made in such a way that they systematically encourage the formation of living structure.  
> I am merely saying that the kinds of CAD-based programs which existed in the era of 1990-2000, because they were intentionally neutral, most often did not have this character.  

*I guess that explains the question above: software is more like a process, a hammer or saw is a tool for a specific step in a process. Are there other differences between these kinds of tools?*
