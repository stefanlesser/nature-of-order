title: "Geometry: uniqueness, regularity, differentiation"
---

> Every part of the world that has life, and every part of every part, becomes *unique*. It becomes unique because each part is adapted to its context and because, in the large, no two contexts are ever the same.  

> We were informed, solemnly, by the architectural theorists of that century, that modularity was an inevitable aspect of production, part of the march of progress, and that it would lead us to triumphs of technology.  
> But uniqueness — the uniqueness of every spot, every part of every place — is a *necessary* aspect of living structure. It is possibly the most fundamental aspect of living structure, and it follows necessarily and without break from the fundamental process itself. It is only in its uniqueness to unique conditions, made necessary by fine adaptation, that anything takes on living form.  
> This is true to such an extent that if the structure of uniqueness at every part does *not* occur within a structure, we can be *sure* that it is not an unfolded whole, not living structure at all.  

> It is the uniqueness of each mountain, building, person, spot, that makes it possible to love it, or him, or her. […]  
> By creating uniqueness everywhere, the living process touches, directly, the issue of whether the world will be a world we love, or not.
