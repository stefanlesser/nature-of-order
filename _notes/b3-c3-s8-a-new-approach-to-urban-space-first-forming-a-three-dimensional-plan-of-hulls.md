title: "8 A new approach to urban space: first forming a three-dimensional plan of hulls"
---

### Coordination needs some form of plan or diagram
> Since it is true that such space is hard to shape, and that shaping it must come first, before shaping buildings — then there must be some way of giving the creation of this system of hulls the **mental and social priority** it needs, then using it as a **common goal for the town**, and getting all the individual acts of construction to participate and complete the geometry of the spaces.  
> That, in turn, requires **a new form of representation**, a new form of plan or diagram. It must be something which is three-dimensional, which is flexible (so that it can absorb the variations and local needs of different building projects), yet something which maintains a real handle on the shape of the *space*, and on the shaped system of *spaces*, that are required to keep the hulls of space throughout the town in good order.  
> I used to think that this large-scale structure — the hulls of space for a town — had to be created piecemeal, as a forest is created from the growth and interaction of the trees, **without a plan**. That is partly true. But I have become convinced, after years of trying to make it work, that it is after all necessary to have some kind of plan.   
> **Pure piecemeal growth just does not work well enough** to create the structure of the larger wholeness needed in a city. The reason is, that it is the large-scale organization of the space, the actual geometric order of the streets and spaces, which matters most.  

> The unfolding process, in the case of a town, is complex and difficult. It cannot always go on, romantically, “by itself”. It needs **guidance of a disciplined kind**, through which the **emerging space is defined, agreed, and visualized in some public and sharable form** of a three-dimensional model. Once we have a way of doing this, the whole thing can go forward easily enough.
