> Merely having the intent to create life, or to make something good, does not guarantee that an ensuing process actually will create life.  

> This modified process is not enormously different from the one that was implemented. But it places more emphasis on the context. It allows people in the process to create things which are more alive in themselves. It encourages creation of living centers at a large scale, at a middle scale, and at a small scale, all simultaneously. It is more likely to be structure-preserving. It is more likely to be respectful of the real feelings and needs people have. It is more context-sensitive, and encourages each place to become locally unique.  
> This is a more living process. The result is likely to be more humane, better for the neighborhood. We judge its greater excellence because of our intuitive grasp of probably consequences, as much as by its conformity to the abstract scheme of chapter 7. It will create a more humane, more livable, more refreshing, and emotionally supportive environment.
