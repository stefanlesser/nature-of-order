title: The void
---

One of the [[15 fundamental properties]].

> The void is the way that the intensity of every center depends on the existence of a still place — en empty center — somewhere in its field.

> In the most profound centers which have perfect wholeness, there is **at the heart a void which is like water, infinite in depth**, surrounded by and contrasted with the clutter of the stuff and fabric all around it.

> It connects with the infinite void, and also with the center of oneself.

> We see it also in certain religious buildings — there, too, one finally comes to this center, to **this central void**. The altar in a church, the **great empty space** at the crossing of a church or mosque — **it is the silence, at the heart**.

> This emptiness is needed, in some form, by every center, large or small. It is **the quiet that draws the center’s energy to itself**, gives it the basis of its strength.

> The fact that the void does not exist so often now, in the buildings and objects we have in our environment, is the result of a general disturbance in our capacity to make wholeness, which is **not a necessary functional property** of office buildings. Most buildings today have **too many small spaces in them, mixed up, scrambled** — often because of a tendency to make many funky, small, “human” spaces. But there is a great lack of **simple, silent, empty, large, calm space**.

> The need for the void arises in all centers. A cup or a bowl rests, as a living center, on the quiet of the space in the bowl itself, its stillness. A painting that is a mass of color rests on some quiet unbroken field of color, less differentiated, and concentrating the quiet to itself. In buildings, a large living room, not cramped — a large hall, not cramped — in ornaments the same. They cannot be all fuss; there must be **a balance of calm and emptiness with the delirious detail**. It is the way a large empty center brings life to a mass of smaller centers.

> Can this be formulated as a principle of symmetry or differentiation? Is there a way that the presence of the void arises mathematically, as part of a stable unified structure, or is it merely a **psychological requirement**? It is the latter. **A living structure can’t be all detail.** The buzz finally diffuses itself, and destroys its own structure. **The calm is needed to alleviate the buzz.**

> Functional examples. **A large area of one material, surrounded by small amounts of another**, is economical and efficient. It is much rarer to find that equal amounts of two materials will do the job.

> Within the buzz of smaller functions, it is always essential to have some larger spaces where a larger, slower and more calm atmosphere pervades. The failure to do this, is one of the main mistakes of modern house and building plans. One of the main things I have learned about houses — no matter how small — is that there must be **a contrast of the small spaces with at least one larger space**, where entirely **different kinds of social and emotional things** can happen.

### In nature
> The void corresponds to the fact that differentiation of minor systems almost always occurs in relation to the “quiet” of some larger and more stable system.
> Thus smaller structures tend to appear around the edge of larger and more homogenous structures.

> A hint of something that might one day be a general theory showing why the void will occur in complex systems to maintain their wholeness, appears in the most general models of fractal geometry.
