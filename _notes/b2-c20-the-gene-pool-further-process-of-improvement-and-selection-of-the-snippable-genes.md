> Under conditions of the Internet, good sequences can be exchanged and spread rapidly. The Internet, a medium where effective sequences can — in principle — be quickly described, shared, modified, and used and reused by millions of people, makes it possible, and vastly accelerates the speed at which information can be exchanged and transformed.  
> It is natural to conceive that a vast system of sequences could be available, and forged, on the Internet. People will then be able to use it as they choose, and the possibility of new and better sequences spreading will almost be assured.  

> The sequences are relatively simple in character. *and they are operational.* That means they give practical instructions which allow people to create or generate versions of things unique to a given circumstance, in a natural and unfolding way. And they are simple enough, so that judging their effectiveness, and seeing how to make improvements is relatively easy.  
> The key thing about all sequences that are *living* sequences is that they generate centers in an order which lets each center unfold naturally from the centers which have been laid down before.  

> What matters is that the goal of a living world has become fairly well-defined. This means that the evolution of sequences can be kept orderly, and does have a useful value-quality which all human beings, from all their different cultures, can — in principle — agree on.
