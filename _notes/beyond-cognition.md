> If we are to use the theory of centers — and the concept of life — as the basis of all architecture, it would be reassuring to know that wholeness, together with the properties which bring centers to life, is **a necessary feature of material reality, not merely a psychological aspect of things which arises during perception** of works of art.

*Alexander might have left behind the mechanist-rational worldview, but he still seems to subscribe to an objectivist worldview, not the experientialist view that his theory would fit so well into. I can only assume that he wasn’t exposed to the works of Lakoff and Johnson and the findings of late 20th-century cognitive science?*

> According to a “cognitive” interpretation, the **centers could merely exist in the mind’s eye (as products of cognition)**, and the fifteen properties, which apparently make the centers work, could also exist merely as artifacts of cognition.
> According to such an interpretation, it might be said that buildings and works of art look good when they are made of centers in the way I have described, *simply because they correspond somehow to deep cognitive structures — that is, to the way human perception and cognition work*.
> In this interpretation, these explanations would be **a powerful way of understanding the *psychology* of buildings and works of art** — and would tell us something important and significant about visual phenomena in the world. But **they would not have implications beyond the psychological** — certainly not for the way the material world *actually works*. By themselves, they would certainly not support my claim that this new view of architecture is necessarily linked to **a new view of space and matter and to the fundamentals of the way the world is made**.

*This seems to address subjectivism, but doesn’t acknowledge more complicated but more accurate models like experientialism.*

> Now, to suggest the unity in which atoms, rivers, buildings, statues, trees, paintings, mountains, windows, and lakes are all part of one unbroken system, I shall argue that **nature too is understandable in terms of wholeness, and must be understood this way**. I shall try to show that the structure of centers I call the **wholeness goes deeper than mere cognition, is linked to the functional and practical behavior of the *natural* world**, not only the architectural world, and is as much **at the foundation of physics and biology** as it is of architecture.
> This will, later, give new insights into the character of nature, how **the unfolding of the wholeness which occurs in nature is responsible for the character of natural structures** — *and how, finally, the unfolding of wholeness might one day be understood as a single law which underlies the entirety of everything we know as nature*.

> It is simply part of the way the world is made that **the non-homogeneity of space leads to progressive differentiations, which then allow different kinds of systems and boundaries to develop**. 
> The zones where conditions are relatively more constant tend to be identified as zones of a single “type”. Then, by contrast with these zones, the transition areas between them tend to become boundary zones.
> 
> This kind of differentiation, which occurs continually throughout the physical world, is **not a matter of our perception. It is real physical organization**, which manifests itself in the world and has functional consequences in the behavior of the systems.

> Further, the **wholeness or integrity of each subsystem creates a center**. When a cell, which has a nucleus and an outer boundary zone, acts as a center within the organism, it becomes stronger than either the boundary zone or the cell nucleus itself. It becomes **mechanically more coherent** as a result of its role in the larger system.

> In general, **the “strength” of any center — its degree of life — is a measure of its organization**.
> One might measure this by its lifetime as a structure, or by its ability to resist disruption, or by its influence on the wholes around it. By almost any of these measures, **the stronger a center is, the more powerful its impact on other nearby centers**, and the more it will **influence the behavior, motion, coagulation, organization, and reorganization** of the other centers which come under its influence.
> Thus the system of powerful centers in the world has a **practical and immediate physical influence** on the behavior of other nearby centers.
