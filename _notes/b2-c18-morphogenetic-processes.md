title: "Morphogenetic processes"
---

> “Morphogenetic” means “creating or generating shape, morphe, form, gestalt”. A sequence is morphogenetic if it does actually unfold to generate a coherent form.  

> First, a sequence is only morphogenetic if it embodies the fifteen transformations, and if it is structure-preserving.  
> Second, a sequence which is morphogenetic will embody, to a greater or less degree, or at least support and encourage, as many as possible of the features of living process, which permit adaptation, structure-preserving transformations, uniqueness, feeling, and simplicity (chapters 7-17).  
> This is a pretty complicated idea, which encompasses, in one word, all of Book 1 and all of Book 2, wrapped up in a single package.  
> What I call morphogenetic is not different from “living” — but it **places the emphasis on the *form-creating* aspect of the sequences. It is, therefore, architectural. It creates the form of the world.**  
> To create life on Earth, the sequences which generate the built world, and which help people do it, must be morphogenetic. That is simple to say and hard to do.  

> Implicit in the description of living process that I have given are whole-seeking processes which can occur in design and in construction — in short, processes which might typically be used by architects and builders and planners.  
> But the built world on Earth is formed by a more diffuse and more extensive system of processes, which comes from all walks of life, and all facets of society. Our built environment, as I have stated, is formed by the interaction of thousands of day-to-day rules, procedures, habits of thought and action. It is these processes, embedded in society, which create the form of the world: streets, parks, buildings, rooms, windows, gardens.  
> Although the myriad rules and processes that exist today can be made slightly more living, by incremental improvement, *the larger task of making these processes genuinely morphogenetic — so that they generate deeper and more coherent living structure — still lies on the horizon*.
