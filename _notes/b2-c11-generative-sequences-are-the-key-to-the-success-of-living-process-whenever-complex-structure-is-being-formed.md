title: "Generative sequences are the key to the success of living process whenever complex structure is being formed"
---

> Unfolding, the essential feature of all living process — which we may also call differentiation — comes about, and succeeds, because it always occurs in a certain kind of *sequence*. It goes step by step, we already know that. But it goes step by step *in a certain order*.  

> In an evolving whole, one thing follows from another. One kind of pattern has to be laid down first, so that another kind of pattern can be introduced to it, can be laid down to complete it. But this is not merely true of biological morphogenesis where it happens necessarily, just because of the way things work. It is a fundamental rule in *all* unfolding. It is linked, inevitably, to the differentiating aspect of the fundamental process. And yet, among the features of living process described in these chapters, it may be both the most surprising rule, and also the most essential one, the one which goes deepest to provide the necessary underpinning of all living structure.
