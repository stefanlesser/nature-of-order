Infrequently updated status report on what’s on my mind right now (regarding this site).

### What’s happening?
What I am working on currently:

* Getting the Telegram group going
	* Add a note about the group
	* Explain group/channel distinction
	* Change all links to group note; link to group only from there
* Making this site work
	* See also: [[Growing this site]]
* Reading Book 3 _A Vision of a Living World_, chapter 4 _Large Public Buildings_, pp. 67-152
	* *this was due on Thursday, 14th January; I’m late on my reading assignments — that means fewer notes added and updated until I catch up…*
* Transferring and editing my private notes from Book 1
