<- [[Center]]

> The centers we see, when we look for wholeness, are not the centers which are captured by words, like “road”, “bike”, and “tree”, but a different set of centers, which have no special words attached to them, *and which are induced structurally by the overall configuration of this scene*.

We tend to see things we have words for, but these things aren’t necessarily the important centers in a scene. We need to quiet down (un-/defocus) that part of our mind that likes to give names to things (categorization), and instead let the overall configuration of a scene structurally induce a different set of centers in the space that we might not have special words for.

> The wholeness and its real system of centers, hidden and not-hidden, are the structures which have impact on the world. We shall not understand how the world works unless we pay attention to the structure of wholeness as it is.
