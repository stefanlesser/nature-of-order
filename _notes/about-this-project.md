Christopher Alexander's magnum opus *The Nature of Order* is not a book about architecture. As its subtitle more accurately states, it is "an essay about **the art of building** and **the nature of the universe**".

The ideas and theory in this work is profound and important for everyone who wants to **design, build, or make** things.

Christopher Alexander is an **architect and design theorist** known for his theories on **human-centered design**. His works have inspired the Design Patterns movement in the software industry, which was an adaptation of his publication *A Pattern Language* to the domain of software architecture.

#### Why should you care about this?
