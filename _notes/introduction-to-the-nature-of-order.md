title: An introduction to _The Nature of Order_
---

*My work-in-progress attempt of providing a thorough introduction to Alexander's theory.*

## The rational / The world / The general

### Living structure: a theory of centers
A theory of living structure describing the geometry of beauty and wholeness and their fifteen fundamental properties.

+ Beauty/wholeness is purely encoded in the geometry of things
+ Hierarchy of centers: differentiated regions of space and matter
+ Nature as a role model for consistently creating wholeness
+ 15 fundamental properties
+ A sense of unity: wholeness in color and 11 color properties

### Living process: the adaptive process
A process to create living structure.

+ From assembling components to differentiating the whole
+ Structure-preserving transformations
+ 15 properties as structure-preserving transformations
+ Patterns and pattern languages
+ "Do the next right thing" â€” sequences to conquer complexity
+ Simplicity and nothingness: towards reaching unity

### The collapse of meaning: critique on our mechanistic world view
How the lack of shared values in our mechanistic and materialistic world prevents the creation of beauty and wholeness.

+ Descartes "trick" that turned into our model of the world
+ No place for art in science: our meaningless experience
+ How Taylorism replaced our desire for harmony with growth
+ The wrong values: growth, ego and individualism
+ Rediscovering harmony: what we really ~~want~~ need
+ Belonging: a real sense of freedom

## The spiritual / Our experience / The personal

### Mirror of the self: a deep connection to living structure
We ~~know~~ feel it when we see it.

+ Hardwired for detecting wholeness
+ Observing our capacity to detect wholeness: empirical foundations
+ The mirror-of-the-self test
+ Personal: idiosyncratic or universal?
+ Feeling as a tool for creating wholeness
+ What Alexander means by "feeling"

### A new world view bringing back meaning
A post-rationalist world view that incorporates human experience and enables us to share values that will help to rebuild our world.

+ We can't deny our experience
+ 

### A new kind of physics: explaining wholeness
Alexander's attempt to explain the universe by connecting the rational to the spiritual.

+ Merging science and art
+ Physics vs. psychology
+ Alexander's search for God
+ _The Nature of Order_ as a work of wholeness
