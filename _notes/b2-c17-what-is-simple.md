title: "What is simple?"
---

> Living process, in its very nature, may, in a certain special sense, be called deeply simple — that it may be *characterized* by the idea that it is **the simplest process which exists in any given set of circumstances**. What has appeared all along, the idea that **complexity is a manifestation of deeper, more intricate structure created by structure-preserving unfolding**, may be understood better yet when we appreciate that **it is always the *simplest* step which governs**: And that the drive provided by the [simplicity and inner calm] transformation is, necessarily, at the very root of living process.  

> The things we call simple in design — cubes, spheres — appear simple conceptually because they can be represented by simple mathematical schemes. But they are not, in any *real* sense, the simplest things which can be created at a given place and time.  
> The simplest thing which can be created, in real terms, is that thing which goes **furthest to resolve, complete, hence to elaborate and underpin the structure of the world, its wholeness, which exists at that place**.  
> In this sense a volcano, a cobweb, an oak tree are truly more simple… because as nearly as we can judge, they **perfectly resolve the forces, processes and conditions at that place, with the greatest economy of means and the greatest economy of form**.  

For software it is essential to figure out, what these phrases could mean in the context of software:
	- perfectly resolve 
		- forces
		- processes
		- conditions
	- with greatest economy of
		- means
		- form
A first step to figure that out should probably be to review what *exactly* they mean in the context of architecture…

> It is for this reason that the simplest forms (“simplest” in this organic and complex sense) must be our targets in any conscious, human-inspired, human-engineered process which aspires to the production of living structure. A process which purports to be a living one, but fails to create beautiful and living simplicity in the physical form it generates, must have something wrong with it.  
> Stated again: the thing which matters most about a living process is — quite simply — that it produces beautiful and coherent geometrical order. That is not only the necessary *result* of a living process. It is also the talisman by which we may know whether a given process is truly living or not. If it is a living process, it will create beautiful geometric structure. If it does *not* create beautiful structure, it can *not* truly be a living process. **Thus the creation of coherent, beautiful, simple geometry and form is not merely an incidental offshoot from the living process. It is the *essence* of any living process.**  
> This gives geometry and beauty — and simplicity above all — a special and central role.
