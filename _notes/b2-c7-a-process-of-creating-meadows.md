A shortened version of [[The fundamental differentiating process]].

> We can produce life in space, according to Christopher Alexander, if we make things following a natural, slow-unfolding process, which involves these steps:  
> (1) Observe and absorb the deep structure of the whole space.  
> (2) Ask what we can do next to most intensify the life of what is before us, by strengthening the strong centers and wholeness already there.  
> (3) Try to do it. Life-generating work always involves strengthening existing strong centers, large or small, and in such a way as to make structure-preserving transformations.  
> (4) Evaluate the result and the new wholeness.  
> (5) Repeat the process step by step.  
> (6) Stop when further improvements in the feeling of the whole cannot be made.
