title: 3 A direct sequence of logical steps leading from people’s wishes to a useful geometric form
---

> Let us follow people’s wishes […], and take them literally, step by step, not introducing anything except what is required to meet these wishes.  

> First fix the height.  
> Building have a maximum height of two and a half stories.  

> Now fix the are of buildings on the ground, per acre.  

> Then fix the daylight.  
> To get good daylight in the apartments, much of the perimeter of each apartment must be open to the sky, not boxed into a big building. In effect this will create buildings which are long and narrow, almost like spaghetti, ribbons of long, thin buildings with open space between them forming gardens and streets.  

> Hence the possibility of individual layout.  

> Then the gardens.  

> Then the lanes.  

> Hence some parking under the street.  

> What people *want* in their housing environment is not obscure. The families have made their wishes clear. And what these wishes lead to, if one follows a logical path, unfolding the design according to people’s wishes, under the conditions imposed by high density, is also not obscure.
