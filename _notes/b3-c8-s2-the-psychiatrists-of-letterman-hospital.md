> If you look at the task of building from a builder’s point of view, or from an administrator’s point of view — especially in a large and complex project — the idea of **involving users** in the discussion, hearing their **conflicting visions**, trying to **reconcile opposing points of view** — can become a political and administrative nightmare.  
> No wonder participation by users is so often refused by administrators — in buildings *and* in towns. The refusal makes some narrow practical sense and business sense. Yet, even so, the refusal is still wrong. Such **hands-on participation** — allowing people to shape their own world as they want it to be — is **a natural right** of people. And it is the only way deep adaptation (and therefore ultimately, people’s satisfaction) can occur.
