title: Living processes

> In the present way of thinking about architecture, one is supposed to design a building completely, occasionally even plan a whole neighborhood, and then use the description (the design, with its plans and drawings) as a specification from which to build. But the essential idea of Book 2 is that it is precisely in this way that architecture has gone wrong, and that it is because of this that living structure rarely appears in contemporary buildings. Instead of using plans, designs, and so on, I shall argue that we *must* instead use generative processes. Generative processes tell us what to *do*, what *actions* to take, step by step, to make buildings and building designs unfold beautifully, rather than detailed drawings which tell us what the *end*-result is supposed to be.  

### The embryo contains a generative rather than a descriptive program
> A descriptive program, like a blueprint or a plan, describes an object in some detail, whereas a generative program describes how to make an object. For the same object the programs are very different.  

*This is declarative vs. imperative programming! And he argues for imperative. Cognitive dissonance galore.*

> Consider origami, the art of paper folding. By folding a piece of paper in various directions, it is quite easy to make a paper hat or a bird from a single sheet. To describe in any detail the final form of the paper with the complex relationships between its parts is really very difficult, and not of much help in explaining how to achieve it. Much more useful and easier to formulate are instructions on how to fold the paper.   
> The reason for this is that **simple instructions about folding have complex spatial consequences**. In development, gene action similarly sets in motion a sequence of events that can bring about profound changes in the embryo. One can thus think of the genetic information in the fertilized egg as equivalent to the folding instructions in origami: both contain a generative program for making a particular structure.  

*How do descriptive and generative programs relate to each other, or can be transformed into each other? And how do imperative and declarative programming fit into that picture? It seems the understanding of the benefits of each are at the core of figuring out which one to use when. It also looks a lot like this is about different perspectives looking at the same thing.*

> **Living structure in buildings can only be *generated*. It cannot be created by brute force from designs.** It can only come from a generative program — hence from a generative process existing in the production process of society — so that the building — its conception, plan, design, detailed layout, structural design, and material detail are all **unfolded, step by step in *time***.  

> In the next chapters I try to specify not only what I mean by living process in technical detail, but also what characteristics are operationally necessary to any process which is a “living” process — in other words, what is necessary to *any* and *every* process which is capable of generating living structure.  

> The practical crux of unfolding, the essence of every living process (what is sometimes described as “emergence” by physicists and biologists) is that it is above all a *geometric* process. That is surprising, and not widely understood. The unfolding is geometrical in its *essence*. Although there are many side features to living process, it is fundamentally the unfolding of coherent *geometric* form, even when it appears loose and “organic”.
