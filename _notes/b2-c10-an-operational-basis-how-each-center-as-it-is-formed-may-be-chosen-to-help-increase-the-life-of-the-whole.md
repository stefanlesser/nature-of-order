title: "An operational basis: How each center, as it is formed, may be chosen to help increase the life of the whole"

> The snow block helps to form an emerging, imperfectly defined idea of a half-spherical building, which is seen in the builder’s mind, and is a target of his actions — imprecise, yet clear enough to steer the cutting and shaping of the individual blocks toward this larger whole. Each block starts as an undifferentiated block, without much existence as a center, then becomes a living center as it is shaped, pushed, trimmed, to take its position in the whole.  

> “The life of the whole” is not hard to see. It is perhaps only hard to force oneself to make the smaller centers *contribute* to that life.   
> But, one might argue that a person does not have a sufficiently clear vision of the (as yet unknown) whole to be able to make a small act contribute. […] But **knowing what to do does not mean knowing what the target is**. It means, having the ability to **go towards an unformulated whole**, because the life and wholeness of the system is visible, “feelable” as a process, even in the absence of a concrete model of the desired end-state.  
> The key fact, and the essence of all living process, is that **experiments** *can* be devised to **help us to determine what the wholeness needs, where it is going, *what* is most structure-preserving to the present whole, *what* contributes to the life of the whole**. […] This is an experimental task that can be successfully performed by identifying latent centers, then strengthening them.  

> Everything that happens in the sequence of events when we design a building, from the first vague ideas to the complete elaboration of the details, can be understood as a progressive unfolding of stronger and stronger centers.
