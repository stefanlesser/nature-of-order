> Most of us share an immediate perception that A-C are more *interesting* than D-G: **more complex, more difficult to describe, richer, and somehow more important**.  
> We may feel this in many ways. One person may feel that A-C are **more interesting simply as works of art, more interesting to look at, would hold the attention better artistically**, if (as plans) they were hung on a wall. D-G are **boring, too simple, one stops looking at them after a few moments**.  

> The concept of “generated” is not quite as straightforward as it seems if one merely look sat the geometry of the plan.
