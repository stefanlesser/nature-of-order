title: 5 The sense of belonging
---

> Our processes of design and building in architecture, as they were in the 20th century, had very little to do with the creation of this sort of belonging. In a sense, indeed, much modern architecture even actually tried to get *away* from this kind of thing.  
> The profession encouraged architects to produce a **visual character**, and pays too little attention to the complex and subtle structure that only living processes create.  
> This weakness of professional architecture is **not helpful** to our everyday lives, nor to our inner lives. **Yet it is accepted** by thousands of professional architects of the “old school”, all over the world, and by hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of **non-architects whose taste has been shaped to fall in line** with such opinions.  
> In this way the prevailing architectural images in the media have robbed millions of us of our common sense, have taught us to go against our own basic instincts and our knowledge of day-to-day reality as it occurs even in ourselves.
