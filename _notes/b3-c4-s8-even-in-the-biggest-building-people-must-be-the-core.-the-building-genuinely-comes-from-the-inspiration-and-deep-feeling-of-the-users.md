title: 8 Even in the biggest building, people must be the core. The building genuinely comes from the inspiration and deep feeling of the users
---

> The core of a living process — whether a building is large or small — is that it comes from people, from their inner desires — and *genuinely* does so; that it meets their archetypal core, and thereby makes them feel at home; and above all that it follows from, and is drawn out from, their inner wishes, which they make actual through dreams, fantasy, and genuine emotional experience.  
> In a big building this is, of course, not so easy. It is not easy to administer — that is, to arrange a process in which the people who will use the building can give voice to what is needed there.  

> Living process must introduce very new elements into almost every aspect of procedure and contract administration.
