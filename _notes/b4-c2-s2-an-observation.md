title: An observation
---

> As a matter of observation, it is simply true to say that many of the most beautiful works of art in the worldâ€™s history, and many of the most profoundly living structures, large and small, that human beings have created, *have been created within the cultural context of some religion*.

---

> After spending my life looking for these profound examples, I have reached the conclusion that the specific living quality I have identified and shown in these four books, almost every time that it has been done most profoundly, *has been done in a mystical-religious context*.
> 
> This observation is not intended suddenly to pave the way to a religious interpretation of what I have said in Books 1 and 2. It is a simple statement of fact which needs some reflection.
> It suggests that there is some aspect of the process of creation which has not yet been covered; that there is some specific quality, introduced into the act of creation by work done in a traditional mystical religious context, which contributes to the formation of living structure.

> In other words, it is not my claim that the works which are the greatest, or deepest, are necessarily *religious* in origin. Nor that they are necessarily old. I am, rather, seeking to identify a quality in these works, which can be explained. If these great works from all periods of history, including even our own, shared a certain cosmological or spiritual background, then that background may have information for us, may give us some hint about the conditions which are *necessary* for the creation of living structure.
