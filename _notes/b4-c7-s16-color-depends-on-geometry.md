title: Color depends on geometry
---

(strong centers, local symmetries)

> Throughout this chapter, I have suggested that the light produced by color is a by-product of the geometric field of centers. It is an aspect of wholeness which occurs as color comes to life. This implies, of course, that behind all these color phenomena, it is the field of centers itself which is working to produce the life. The geometric structure of the field is necessary to produce the light within the framework of geometry. Geometric structure is *required* to intensify and unify color.

> The hunch that there is an intimate connection between wholeness of color and wholeness of geometry, is borne out empirically. Somehow, apparently then, there is an intimate connection between wholeness of color and wholeness of geometry. Specifically I make this observation: *We can never achieve inner light when the field of centers is not present geometrically.* And the reverse is also true: *We cannot achieve the unity of the field of centers geometrically, unless it is supported by wholeness of color and inner light.*

> It is fairly easy to see this in almost all the examples we have looked at. The beauty of color comes not only from the beautiful interplay of colors, but from the geometry as well. We learn the power of this effect fully when we ourselves try to produce inner light. We find then, that it is actually impossible to do unless we also create geometric wholeness as the substrate for the color.

> Thus the geometric wholeness is not merely beautiful in itself as an accompaniment to the beautiful color. It is essential, necessary, for the release of light. Color, far from being an incidental attribute of things, is fundamental to the living structure of wholeness. Inner light is not merely a color phenomenon, but the character of wholeness when it “melts”.
